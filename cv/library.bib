abstract = {Global gravity field models have been determined based on kinematic\norbits covering an observation period of one year beginning from\nMarch 2002. Three different models have been derived up to a maximum\ndegree of n = 90 of a spherical harmonic expansion of the gravitational\npotential. One version, ITG-CHAMP01E, has been regularized beginning\nfrom degree n = 40 upwards, based on the potential coefficients of\nthe gravity field model EGM96. A second model, ITG-CHAMP01K, has\nbeen determined based on Kaula's rule of thumb, also beginning from\ndegree n = 40. A third version, ITG-CHAMP01S, has been determined\nwithout any regularization. The physical model of the gravity field\nrecovery technique is based on Newton's equation of motion, formulated\nas a boundary value problem in the form of a Fredholm-type integral\nequation. The observation equations are formulated in the space domain\nby dividing the one-year orbit into short sections of approximately\n30-minute arcs. For every short arc, a variance factor has been determined\nby an iterative computation procedure. The three gravity field models\nhave been validated based on various criteria, and demonstrate the\nquality of not only the gravity field recovery technique but also\nthe kinematically determined orbits. ?� Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg\n2005.},

abstract = {This paper investigates orbits and transfer trajectories for continuous polar Earth observation in the Earth-Moon system. The motivation behind this work is to complement the services offered by polar-orbiting spacecraft, which offer high resolution imaging but poor temporal resolution, due to the fact that they can only capture one narrow swath at each polar passage. Conversely, a platform for high-temporal resolution imaging can enable a number of applications, from accurate polar weather forecasting to Aurora study, as well as direct-link telecommunications with high-latitude regions. Such a platform would complement polar orbiters. In this work, we make use of resonant gravity swing-by manoeuvres at the Moon in order to design trajectories that are suitable for quasi-continuous polar observation. In particular, it is shown that the Moon can flip the line of apsides of a highly eccentric, highly inclined orbit from north to south, without the need for thrust. In this way, a spacecraft can alternatively loiter for an extended period of time above the two poles. In addition, at the lunar encounter it is possible to change the period of time spent on each pole. In addition, we also show that the lunar swing-by can be exploited for transfer to a so-called pole-sitter orbit, i.e. a spacecraft that constantly hovers above one of the Earths poles using continuous thrust. It is shown that, by using the Moons gravity to change the inclination of the transfer trajectory, the total ??v is less than using a trajectory solely relying on high-thrust or low-thrust, therefore enabling the launchers to inject more mass into the target pole-sitter position. ?? 2014 IAA.},

abstract = {It is possible to easily measure variations of intensity of the earth's gravity field by orbiting two geometrically identical satellites spaced about 200 kilometers apart and equipped to measure their relative velocity. The velocity difference is related to the space gradient of the potential field, which is a totally different concept of measurement, compared with present methods that measure the long-term integrated effects of gravity on orbit elements. It is expected that one month of satellite time would yield one set of measurements of the gravity anomalies of the entire earth with sensitivity at least 1 mgal ten times better than present world surveys. The cost is comparatively small and, in view of cost reduction for other related programs, may even be a substantial saving in total.},

abstract = {The Earth's gravitational field from the Next-Generation Gravimetry Mission (NGGM) and the Improved-Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Improved-GRACE) complete up to degree and order 120 is recovered by a closed-loop numerical simulation using different orbital altitudes of 325 and 300 km, different orbital inclinations of 96.78° and 89° and different inter-satellite ranges of 10 and 50 km. The preferred orbit parameters of the future twin Improved-GRACE satellites are proposed based on the results of the simulations in this study. The research results show: (1) In order to achieve the scientific objectives, which require that the accuracy of the next-generation Earth gravity field models is at least one order of magnitude better than that of the current gravity models, the orbit design at an altitude of 300 ± 50 km is recommended for the future Improved-GRACE mission. This altitude is determined by a trade-off analysis between the recovery accuracy of the gravity field and the operational lifetime of the satellite system. (2) Because the accuracy of the Earth's gravitational field from NGGM with an orbital inclination of 96.78° will be decreased due to a lack of the observation data in the polar areas, we propose that a near-polar orbit (inclination of 89° ± 2°) is a preferable selection for the future twin Improved-GRACE satellites. (3) The future Improved-GRACE mission has to adopt an inter-satellite range of 50 ± 10 km, because the common signals of the Earth's gravitational field between the twin NGGM satellites will be substantially eliminated with a shorter inter-satellite range of 10 km. With these orbit design parameters, the Earth's gravitational field from the Improved-GRACE mission is precisely recovered complete up to degree and order 120 with a cumulative geoid height error of about 0.7 mm.},

@article{Liu2016a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. The anomaly phenomenon of broadcast ionospheric model coefficients of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is revealed after analyzing the navigation file data collected from all the IGS (International GNSS Service) stations worldwide over a 22-year period (1992–2013). GPS broadcast ionospheric coefficients widely used by many single-frequency users to correct the ionosphere errors for numerous GPS applications are usually believed to have only one set/version per day. However, it is found that GPS receivers from the IGS network can report as many as eight sets/versions of ionospheric coefficients in a day. In order to investigate the possible factors for such an anomalous phenomenon, the relationship between the number of coefficient sets and solar cycle, the receiver geographic locations, and receiver types/models are analyzed in detail. The results indicate that most of the coefficients show an annual variation. During the active solar cycle period from mid-1999 to mid-2001, all of the coefficients extracted from IGS navigation files behaved anomalously. Our analysis shows that the anomaly is also associated with GPS receiver types/models. Some types/models of GPS receivers report one set/version of ionospheric coefficients daily, while others report multiple sets. Our analysis also suggests that the ionospheric coefficient anomaly is not necessarily related to ionospheric scintillations. No correlation between the anomaly and geographic location of GPS receivers has been found in the analysis. Using the ionospheric coefficient data collected from 1998 to 2013, the impact of ionospheric coefficient anomaly on vertical total electron content (VTEC) calculation using the Klobuchar model has been evaluated with respect to the Global Ionospheric Maps generated by the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe. With different sets of coefficients recorded on the same day, the resulting VTEC values are dramatically different. For instance on June 1, 2000, the largest VTEC at one of our test stations can be as large as 153.3 TECu (total electron content unit) using one set of coefficients, which is 16.36 times larger than the smallest VTEC of 9.37 TECu computed from using another set of coefficients.},

abstract = {In 2009 the European Space Agency satellite mission GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) was launched. Its objectives are the precise and detailed determination of the Earth's gravity field and geoid. Its core instrument, a three axis gravitational gradiometer, measures the gravity gradient components V xx , V yy , V zz and V xz (second-order derivatives of the gravity potential V) with high precision and V xy , V yz with low precision, all in the instrument reference frame. The long wavelength gravity field is recovered from the orbit, measured by GPS (Global Positioning System). Characteristic elements of the mission are precise star tracking, a Sun-synchronous and very low (260 km) orbit, angular control by magnetic torquing and an extremely stiff and thermally stable instrument environment. GOCE is complementary to GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment), another satellite gravity mission, launched in 2002. While GRACE is designed to measure temporal gravity variations, albeit with limited spatial resolution, GOCE is aiming at maximum spatial resolution, at the expense of accuracy at large spatial scales. Thus, GOCE will not provide temporal variations but is tailored to the recovery of the fine scales of the stationary field. GRACE is very successful in delivering time series of large-scale mass changes of the Antarctic ice sheet, among other things. Currently, emphasis of respective GRACE analyses is on regional refinement and on changes of temporal trends. One of the challenges is the separation of ice mass changes from glacial isostatic adjustment. Already from a few months of GOCE data, detailed gravity gradients can be recovered. They are presented here for the area of Antarctica. As one application, GOCE gravity gradients are an important addition to the sparse gravity data of Antarctica. They will help studies of the crustal and lithospheric field. A second area of application is ocean circulation. The geoid surface from the gravity field model GOCO01S allows us now to generate rather detailed maps of the mean dynamic ocean topography and of geostrophic flow velocities in the region of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.},

Monthly repeated gravity measurements were coupled with deformation time series using the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique on two sequences of interferograms from ERS/ENVISAT and COSMO-SkyMed satellites. Combining spatiotemporal gravity and DInSAR observations provides the signature of three underlying processes at Etna: (i) magma accumulation in intermediate storage zones, (ii) magmatic intrusions at shallow depth in the South Rift area, and (iii) the seaward sliding of the volcano's eastern flank. Here we demonstrate the strength of the complementary gravity and DInSAR analysis in discerning among different processes and, thus, in detecting deep magma uprising in months to years before the onset of a new Etna eruption.},

abstract = {The space–time history of fault slip during the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Mw 9.0) is determined using high sample rate three‐component Global Positioning System (GPS) recordings from regional stations across Japan, teleseismic broadband P waves, global R1 source time functions determined by empirical Green's function deconvolutions of short‐arc Rayleigh waves, and ocean‐bottom deformation observations. Least‐squares inversions are performed for models with prescribed rupture‐front expansion velocity. Joint inversion yields improved resolution of slip compared with inversions using any single data type for both checkerboard rupture simulations and the actual data. Joint inversion stabilizes inversions with respect to some key parameters, such as the rupture expansion velocity and subfault total rupture durations, due to lower dependence on these parameters of some datasets (mainly the high sample rate [1 sample/s] three‐component GPS recordings [hr‐GPS] data). The preferred joint inversion model has a seismic moment estimate of 4.2×1022 N{\textperiodcentered}m (Mw 9.0), with a primary large‐slip patch with maximum slip of ∼50–60 m located up‐dip of the hypocenter on the shallow megathrust and distributed slip of 20–30 m near the hypocenter. A down‐dip low‐slip extension to the south is also resolved, with centroid source time later than 110 s.Online Material: Figures of inverted slip distributions and associated source time functions and centroid times, and waveform fits.},

abstract = {Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is a very important component governing global changes. TWS change ($\Delta$TWS) can only be estimated by hydrological modeling before 2002 when the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) space mission provided a highly valuable data set that allows studying of $\Delta$TWS over large river basins worldwide since then. The lifetime of GRACE, however, is still too short to meet the needs for studying long term variability of $\Delta$TWS during the past decades. In this paper, we reconstructed monthly and annual $\Delta$TWS time series over the Amazon Basin in the past 65 years by use of GRACE-based TWS anomaly (TWSA) data and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) products. The rationality of the reconstructed annual $\Delta$TWS time series was indirectly evaluated by examining the historic coherence between $\Delta$TWS and El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation under conditions of poor availability of in situ observation data and lack of reference work published in Amazon Basin. These datasets offer a unique opportunity for understanding the varying characteristics of $\Delta$TWS in the Amazon during the past 65 years. Besides improving our knowledge of long-term water resource variations in this large river basin, these reconstructed datasets not only contribute to droughts monitoring, but also provide a new perspective for understanding water resource variations in other big river basins.},

abstract = {We present Bedmap2, a new suite of gridded products describing surface elevation, ice-thickness and the seafloor and subglacial bed elevation of the Antarctic south of 60◦ S. We derived these products using data from a va- riety of sources, including many substantial surveys com- pleted since the original Bedmap compilation (Bedmap1) in 2001. In particular, the Bedmap2 ice thickness grid is made from 25 million measurements, over two orders of magnitude more than were used in Bedmap1. In most parts of Antarc- tica the subglacial landscape is visible in much greater de- tail than was previously available and the improved data- coverage has in many areas revealed the full scale of moun- tain ranges, valleys, basins and troughs, only fragments of which were previously indicated in local surveys. The de- rived statistics for Bedmap2 show that the volume of ice contained in the Antarctic ice sheet (27 millionkm3) and its potential contribution to sea-level rise (58m) are simi- lar to those of Bedmap1, but the mean thickness of the ice sheet is 4.6% greater, the mean depth of the bed beneath the grounded ice sheet is 72m lower and the area of ice sheet grounded on bed below sea level is increased by 10 %. The Bedmap2 compilation highlights several areas beneath the ice sheet where the bed elevation is substantially lower than the deepest bed indicated by Bedmap1. These products, along with grids of data coverage and uncertainty, provide new opportunities for detailed modelling of the past and fu- ture evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.},

abstract = {A consistent analysis of signal-in-space ranging errors (SISREs) is presented for all current satellite navigation systems, considering both global average values and worst-user-location statistics. The analysis is based on 102year of broadcast ephemeris messages of the Global Positioning System (GPS) , GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou and QZSS collected with a near-global receiver network. Position and clock values derived from the navigation data are compared against precise orbit and clock products provided by the International GNSS Service and its multi-GNSS experiment. Satellite laser ranging measurements are used for a complementary and independent assessment of the orbit-only SISRE contribution. The need for proper consideration of antenna offsets is highlighted and block-/constellation-specific radial antenna offset values for the center-of-mass correction of broadcast orbits are derived. Likewise, the need for application of differential code biases in the comparison of broadcast and precise clock products is emphasized. For GPS, the analysis of the legacy navigation message is complemented by a discussion of the CNAV message performance based on the first CNAV test campaign in June 2013. Global average SISRE values for the individual constellations amount to 0.702±020.0202m (GPS), 1.502±020.102m (BeiDou), 1.602±020.302m (Galileo), 1.902±020.102m (GLONASS), and 0.602±020.202m (QZSS) over a 12-month period in 2013/2014.},

abstract = {The acquisition of real-time satellite orbit and clock corrections is necessary for real-time PPP. There are nine International GNSS Service (IGS) analysis centers (ACs) that provide real-time satellite orbit and clock products. Given the influence of network transmission, observation data and solution methods, a single AC product suffers from outages and outliers. A combination of real-time data streams is an effective method of improving these problems. We focus on a combination method with regard to anomalous data in a single AC solution. Processing techniques such as parameter separation, weight estimation and exception handling are proposed. Experimental results indicate that, after the process, the frequency of unavailability and anomaly in the combined (simply COMB later) clock correction obtained using the above-mentioned method decreases relative to that of a single AC and IGS01 and IGS02 products. IGS01 is a single-epoch combined product provided by European Space Agency (ESA). IGS02 is a Kalman filter combined product provided by the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG). In a 7-day experimental period, the performance of real-time products is also examined regarding availability and accuracy. The availability of COMB is as high as 99.9 {%}, which is superior to that of single AC and IGS01 and IGS02 products. The accuracy of COMB is 0.15 ns in standard deviation, which is at the same level as the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) product, but higher by 40, 17, 29, 42 and 32 {%} than that of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), ESA, GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ), IGS01 and IGS02 products. The 3D positioning accuracy applying COMB product is 9.1 cm in root mean square (RMS), which is higher by 41, 44, 5, 43, 43 and 42 {%} than applying CNES, DLR, ESA, GFZ, IGS01 and IGS02 products, respectively. The results demonstrate that the real-time COMB clock correction obtained by the method proposed is more stable and reliable than single AC and IGS01 and IGS02 products.},

In this far continent where almost all the rocky surface is covered by the ice sheet, seismic investigations do not reach a sufficient spatial resolution for geological and geophysical purposes. Here, we computed a global map of Antarctic crustal thicknesses based on space gravity observations. The DIR5 gravity field model, built from GOCE and also GRACE gravimetric data, is inverted with the Parker–Oldenburg's iterative algorithm. The BEDMAP products are used to estimate the gravity effect of the ice and the rocky surface. Our result is compared to crustal thickness provided by seismological studies, CRUST1.0 and AN1 models. Although CRUST1.0 shows a very good agreement with our model, the spatial resolution is smaller with gravimetric data. Finally, we adjust the crust/mantle density contrast considering the Moho depth from CRUST1.0 model. In East Antarctica, the density contrast clearly shows higher values than in West Antarctica.},

The 8-constituent dynamics-based model uses the latest "IBCAO'' bathymetry, and open boundary forcing from the recent TPXO. 6.2 global barotropic tidal solution. This model performs significantly better than the present benchmark Arctic tidal model (14-km grid) by Z. Kowalik and A. Proshutinsky, as judged by comparisons with similar to 300 coastal tide gauges. The greatest improvements are found in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Nares Strait, and the Baffin Bay and Labrador Sea, and can be explained by the higher resolution of the new model in these topographically complex regions. The new Arctic inverse model assimilates coastal and benthic tide gauges and TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS altimetry for further improvements of the 4 dominant constituents M-2, S-2, K-1 and O-1.},

abstract = {We examine geoid rates and ocean mass corrections from two published global glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models, both of which have been used in previous studies to estimate ocean mass trends from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite gravity data. These two models are different implementations of the same ice loading history and use similar mantle viscosity profiles. The model results are compared with each other and with geoid rates determined from GRACE during August 2002 to November 2009. When averaged over the global ocean, the two models have rates that differ by nearly 1 mm yr -1 of ocean mass, with the first model giving a correction closer to 2 mm yr-1 and the second closer to 1 mm yr-1. By comparing the two models, we have discovered that 50% of the difference is caused by a global (land + ocean) mean in the first model. While it is appropriate to include this mean when subtracting GIA effects from measurements of sea level change measured by tide gauges or satellite altimetry, the mean should not be included when subtracting GIA effects from ocean mass variations derived from satellite gravity data. When this mean is removed, the ocean mass corrections from the two models still disagree by 0.4 mm yr-1. We trace the residual difference to the fact that the first model also has large trends over the ocean related to large rates in its predicted degree 2, order 1 geoid coefficients. Such oceanic trends are not observed by GRACE nor are they predicted by the second model, and they are shown to be inconsistent with the polar wander rates predicted by the first model itself. If these two problems are corrected, we find that the two model predictions agree at the 3% level. On the basis of this analysis, we conclude that the ocean mass correction for GRACE is closer to 1 mm yr-1 than 2 mm yr-1, although significant uncertainties remain. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

When compared to Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008), it is more accurate at low to medium resolution thanks to GOCE and GRACE data. When compared to earlier releases of ESA GOCE models, it is more accurate at high degrees owing to the larger amount of data ingested. It is also slightly more accurate than ESA's fourth release of the time-wise model (TIM-R4), as demonstrated by GPS/leveling, orbit determination tests, and an oceanographic evaluation.

abstract = {The atmosphere and ocean of the North Atlantic have undergone significant changes in the past century. To understand these changes, their mechanisms, and their regional implications requires a quantitative understanding of processes in the coupled ocean and atmosphere system. Central to this understanding is the role played by the dominant patterns of ocean and atmospheric variability which define coherent variations in physical characteristics over large areas. Cluster analysis is used in this article to identify the patterns of the North Atlantic atmospheric variability in the subseasonal and interannual spectral intervals. Four dominant subseasonal weather regimes are defined using Bayesian Gaussian mixture models. All correlation patterns of the Sea Level Pressure (SLP) anomalies with the membership probability time series for the weather regimes show similarities with the dipole structure typical for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The SLP patterns of two of the regimes represent the opposite phases NAO+ and NAO-. The two other weather regimes, the Atlantic Ridge (AR) and Scandinavian-Greenland dipole (SG), have dipole spatial structures with the northern and southern centers of action shifted with respect to the NAO pattern. These two patterns define blocking structures over Scandinavia and near the southern tip of Greenland, respectively. The storm tracks typical for the four regimes resemble the well known paths for positive/negative phases of NAO for the NAO+/NAO- weather regimes, and paths influenced by blocking off the south Greenland tip for AR and over Scandinavia for SG. The correlation patterns of momentum and heat fluxes to the ocean for the four regimes have tripole structures with positive (warm) downward heat flux anomalies over the Subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) for the NAO- and the AR and negative heat flux anomalies over the SPNA for the NAO+. The downward heat flux anomalies associated with the SG are negative over the Labrador Sea and positive over the eastern SPNA. The long term impact of the weather regimes on the regional climate is characterized by their distribution; i.e. the frequency of occurrence and persistence in time of each of them. Four typical distributions of the weather regimes are identified in this study which are associated with four dominant spatial interannual patterns representing the phases of two asymmetrical “modes”. The first two patterns have the spatial structures of positive and negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The third and fourth patterns, here referred to as G+ and G-, define the opposite phases of a mode, that has a spatial structure defined by three centers found over Florida, south of Greenland and over Scandinavia. The NAO+ interannual patterns are associated with negative anomalies of the surface downward heat flux and ocean heat content over the SPNA. The NAO- and G+ are associated with positive anomalies of heat flux and ocean heat content. In the 1960s the dominant NAO- and G+ interannual patterns favored warmer than normal atmospheric and ocean temperatures over the SPNA. The winters in the late 1980s and early 1990s over the SPNA were colder than normal. This decadal shift in the atmospheric state between 1970s and 1980s was associated with a change in the dominant interannual patterns towards NAO+ and G- in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The recent warming of the SPNA since the mid-1990s was related to dominance of the G+/G- interannual patterns in the distribution of interannual patterns probability membership. Our analysis suggests that this decadal variability was associated with long term shifts in atmospheric behavior over the SPNA that can be described by a change in the 1980s of the distribution of membership probabilities for the the interannual patterns. Within the interannual pattern phase space, this change is characterized with a shift from the NAO-/G+/G- subspace in the 1950 and 1960s, towards NAO+/G+/G- since the mid 1980s.},

abstract = {Computational modeling of Earth system processes often requires simplifying assumptions of the real system. These necessary assumptions result in the definition of internal model parameters that can take a number of different values but must be explicitly defined for any one model simulation. The main issue with such an uncertain multidimensional input space is that many simulations are needed to adequately explore it. This study presents a generalized parameter screening experiment for use in future earth system modeling. This approach identifies model parameters that dominate uncertainty, therefore reducing to a manageable number the simulations required to explore the input space. The approach we adopt is relatively inexpensive to implement and can be applied at both the aggregate and disaggregate (e.g., regional) level. To demonstrate the potential of such a method, it is applied to a surface mass balance model of intermediate complexity over the Greenland ice sheet. All identified parameters were related to the surface melt parameterization, with albedo parameters being identified as the most important. Spatial distributions of the parameter sensitivities show that, in recent years, most parameter sensitivities are concentrated around the southwest and northern ice sheet margins. Simulations for the 21st century indicate an increase in sensitivity in these high melt areas especially in the northeast. Melt contributions from temperature and radiative effects are shown to be important on the order of parameters identified, and as a consequence, sensitivities are dependent on the present climate used for modeling surface mass balance.},

abstract = {Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) encompasses a suite of geophysical phenomena accompanying the waxing and waning of continental-scale ice sheets. These involve the solid Earth, the oceans and the cryosphere both on short (decade to century) and on long (millennia) timescales. In the framework of contemporary sea-level change, the role of GIA is particular. In fact, among the processes significantly contributing to contemporary sea-level change, GIA is the only one for which deformational, gravitational and rotational effects are simultaneously operating, and for which the rheology of the solid Earth is essential. Here, I review the basic elements of the GIA theory, emphasizing the connections with current sea-level changes observed by tide gauges and altimetry. This purpose is met discussing the nature of the ``sea-level equation'' (SLE), which represents the basis for modeling the sea-level variations of glacial isostatic origin, also giving access to a full set of geodetic variations associated with GIA. Here, the SLE is employed to characterize the remarkable geographical variability of the GIA-induced sea-level variations, which are often expressed in terms of ``fingerprints''. Using harmonic analysis, the spatial variability of the GIA fingerprints is compared to that of other components of contemporary sea-level change. In closing, some attention is devoted to the importance of the ``GIA corrections'' in the context of modern sea-level observations, based on tide gauges or satellite altimeters.},

abstract = {We present a method for 3-D gravity inversion designed to obtain density contrast models described by subhorizontal layers limited by irregular discontinuity interfaces and models constituted by shallow basins with light infill. It is based on a previously published inversion method that provides, in a nearly automatic approach, the 3-D geometry of isolated anomalous bodies. The basic adjustment constraints are model fitness (fitting the anomaly data) and model smoothness (minimizing the total anomalous mass). For models corresponding to subhorizontal layers, we consider an additional minimization condition: the proximity to prescribed horizontal interfaces. This condition is arranged by including an additional weighting (inverse proportional to the distance to the interface) in the covariance matrix for model parameters. The approach works, according a growth process that increases, step by step, the volume of the adjusted anomalous bodies. Some advantages of the method are simultaneous adjustment of a (linear) regional gravity trend, possibility of including simultaneously positive and negative anomalous structures in the model, and unified inversion approach for isolated bodies, basins, and subhorizontal interface structures. We include several simulation examples and an application case (layered model for the volcanic island of Tenerife). Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Satellite Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is suited to monitoring ground deformation on the scale of volcanic arcs, providing insight into the eruptive cycle over both long and short time periods. However, these measurements are often contaminated with atmospheric artefacts caused by changes in the refractivity of the atmosphere. Here, we test the use of two large-scale atmospheric models, ERA-Interim (ERA-I) and North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), to correct atmospheric uncertainties in InSAR data from the Cascades Volcanic Arc, United States. At Lassen Volcanic Center, we find that NARR reduces interferogram standard deviation in 79% of cases by an average of 22%.Using NARR, we develop a strategy to produce a priori estimates of atmospheric uncertainties on an arc-wide basis. We show that in the Cascades, the RMS variation in range change is dependent upon volcano topography and increases by 0.7. cm per kilometre of relief. We use this to estimate detection thresholds for long-term monitoring of small magnitude (1. cm/yr) deformation signals, and short-term monitoring of ground deformation associated with pre-eruptive unrest. This new approach of assessing atmospheric uncertainties a priori is widely applicable to other volcanic arcs, and provides realistic estimates of atmospheric uncertainties suitable for use in near-real-time analysis of InSAR data during periods of volcanic unrest.},

abstract = {Swarm is a three-satellite mission of the European Space Agency, in orbit since November 2013, whose main objective is the study of the Earth's magnetic field from space. As part of other scientific payload, each Swarm satellite is equipped with an accelerometer that measures the nongravitational forces (e.g. atmospheric drag and radiation pressure). Since the mission beginning, the Swarm onboard accelerometer observations have been facing a problem of much higher temperature influence than it had been anticipated in the pre-launch tests. In our paper, we use the a posteriori computed models of physical nongravitational forces acting on each satellite for external validation of the accelerometer measurements. To reduce the high temperature dependence, we apply a simple and straightforward method of linear temperature correction. The most successful application of this approach is for the along-track component of the accelerometer data, where the signal magnitude is strongest. The best performing accelerometer is that of the Swarm C satellite, the accelerometer of Swarm A displays more temperature dependence and noise, the noisiest accelerometer data set is provided by Swarm B. We analyzed the occurrence of anomalous periods in the along-track accelerometer component of Swarm A and Swarm C, when the number of accelerometer hardware anomalies is peaking. Over the time interval from June 2014 to December 2015, we found a correlation between these anomalous periods and the minima in the time-varying part of the modelled nongravitational signal.},

abstract = {Information on gas–surface interactions in orbit has accumulated during the past 35 years. The important role played by atomic oxygen adsorbed on satellite surfaces has been revealed by the analysis of data from orbiting mass spectrometers and pressure gauges. Data from satellites of special design have yielded information on the energy accommodation and angular distributions of molecules reemitted from satellite surfaces. Consequently, it is now possible to calculate satellite drag coefficients from basic physical principles, utilizing parameters of gas–surface interactions measured in orbit. The results of such calculations are given. They show the drag coefficients of four satellites of different compact shapes in low-earth orbit with perigee altitudes in the range from about 150 to 300 km, where energy accommodation coefficients and diffuse angular distributions have been measured. The calculations are based on Sentman's analysis of drag forces in free-molecular flow. His model incorporates the random thermal motion of the incident molecules, and assumes that all molecules are diffusely reemitted The uncertainty caused by the assumption of diffuse reemission is estimated by using Schamberg's model of gas–surface interaction, which can take into account a quasi-specular component of the reemission. Such a quasi-specular component is likely to become more important at higher altitudes as the amount of adsorbed atomic oxygen decreases. A method of deducing accommodation coefficients and angular distributions at higher altitudes by comparing the simultaneous orbital decay of satellites of different shapes at a number of altitudes is suggested.

abstract = {This paper proposes an end-of-life propellant-free disposal strategy for Libration-point orbits which uses solar radiation pressure to restrict the evolution of the spacecraft motion. The spacecraft is initially disposed into the unstable manifold leaving the Libration-point orbit, before a reflective sun-pointing surface is deployed to enhance the effect of solar radiation pressure. Therefore, the consequent increase in energy prevents the spacecraft's return to Earth. Three European Space Agency missions are selected as test case scenarios: Herschel, SOHO and Gaia. Guidelines for the end-of-life disposal of future Libration-point orbit missions are proposed and a preliminary study on the effect of the Earth's orbital eccentricity on the disposal strategy is shown for the Gaia mission.},

abstract = {We consider the computational challenges associated with uncertainty quantification involved in parameter estimation such as seismic slowness and hydraulic transmissivity fields. The reconstruction of these parameters can be mathematically described as Inverse Problems which we tackle using the Geostatistical approach. The quantification of uncertainty in the Geostatistical approach involves computing the posterior covariance matrix which is prohibitively expensive to fully compute and store. We consider an efficient representation of the posterior covariance matrix at the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point as the sum of the prior covariance matrix and a low-rank update that contains information from the dominant generalized eigenmodes of the data misfit part of the Hessian and the inverse covariance matrix. The rank of the low-rank update is typically independent of the dimension of the unknown parameter. The cost of our method scales as O(mlogm) where mdimension of unknown parameter vector space. Furthermore, we show how to efficiently compute measures of uncertainty that are based on scalar functions of the posterior covariance matrix. The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated by application to model problems in synthetic travel-time tomography and steady-state hydraulic tomography. We explore the accuracy of the posterior covariance on different experimental parameters and show that the cost of approximating the posterior covariance matrix depends on the problem size and is not sensitive to other experimental parameters.},

abstract = {In this contribution, we focus on both the functional and stochastic models of GPS short baseline time series. Biases in the observations can be interpreted as due to an incomplete functional model. Multipath, as a major part of errors, is believed to induce periodic effects on the carrier-phase observations over short time spans (a few minutes). Here, we employ a harmonic estimation method to include a set of harmonic functions in the functional model. Such sinusoidal functions are introduced to compensate for periodic systematic effects in GPS short baselines time series. This guarantees the property of unbiasedness of the least-squares estimators. On the other hand, the covariance matrix of observables is, in practice, generally based on the supposition of uncorrelated observables. A realistic description of the measurement noise characteristics, through the observation covariance matrix, is required to yield minimum variance (best) estimators. We will use least-squares variance component estimation to assess time-correlated noise of GPS receivers. Receiver noise characteristics are traditionally assessed through special zero baseline measurements. With the technique introduced in this paper we demonstrate that we can reach the same conclusions using (ordinary) short baseline measurements.},

abstract = {Tidal gravity observations can be used to validate theoretical estimation for inelastic response of the Earth and its latitude dependence using gravimetric factors. We used superconducting gravimeter (SG) data at five sites (METSAHOVI, STRASBOURG, SUTHERLAND, CANBERRA and SYOWA) to validate theoretical estimation based on an existing method. For the correction of ocean loading effect, we tested eight global ocean tide models, four OLD (CSR4.0, GOT99.2b, NAO.99b and FES2004) and four NEW (TPXO7-atlas, EOT11a, DTU10 and HAMTIDE11a) were tested. We selected an optimal ocean tide model based on the criterion of the smallest misfit for the three main waves (O1, K1 and M2) at each station, as determined by the residual between the observed loading effect and the modelled ocean loading effect. Large discrepancies among the results of ocean tide models remained at METSAHOVI and SYOWA; however, the correction of the ocean loading effect using NEW ocean tide models exhibited consistency with body tide theoretical values of inelasticity. Regarding the validation of elasticity/inelasticity, the properties at all stations approached the inelastic theoretical value for K1. It was difficult to clarify the latitude dependence of tidal response, because of still inaccurate ocean loading correction at SYOWA and SUTHERLAND. In summary, revision of the calibration factor at METSAHOVI reduced the real (in-phase) component of the final residual; however, a more accurate calibration factor is still needed. Data from STRASBOURG showed consistency with theoretical values for inelasticity including OLD and NEW ocean tide models. Results from SUTHERLAND gave a larger gravimetric factor, even using the NEW optimal ocean tide model, and the data at CANBERRA supported OLD ocean tide model. The NEW ocean tide models TPXO7-atlas and DTU10 reduced the residual in both the in-phase and out-phase components for O1, K1 and M2 as compared with FES2004, but relatively large residuals still remained in both components for K1 at SUTHERLAND, in the in-phase component for M2 at CANBERRA and in the out-phase component for M2 at SYOWA. These residuals mean that there is a room for improvement in the estimation of ocean loading effect and/or the determination of calibration factors at these sites.},

abstract = {The restricted sensitivity of the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) gradiometer instrument requires satellite gravity gradiometry to be supplemented by orbit analysis in order to resolve long-wavelength features of the geopotential. For the hitherto published releases of the GOCE time-wise (TIM) and GOCE space-wise gravity field series - two of the official ESA products - the energy conservation method has been adopted to exploit GPS-based satellite-to-satellite tracking information. On the other hand, gravity field recovery from data collected by the CHAllenging Mini-satellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite showed the energy conservation principle to be a sub-optimal choice. For this reason, we propose to estimate the low-frequency part of the gravity field by the point-wise solution of Newton's equation of motion, also known as the acceleration approach. This approach balances the gravitational vector with satellite accelerations, and hence is characterized by (second-order) numerical differentiation of the kinematic orbit. In order to apply the method to GOCE, we present tailored processing strategies with regard to low-pass filtering, variance-covariance information handling, and robust parameter estimation. By comparison of our GIWF solutions (initials GI for "Geod??tisches Institut" and IWF for "Institut f??r WeltraumForschung") and the GOCE-TIM estimates with a state-of-the-art gravity field solution derived from GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment), we conclude that the acceleration approach is better suited for GOCE-only gravity field determination as opposed to the energy conservation method. ?? 2012 COSPAR.

abstract = {Understanding water storage changes within the Nile's main sub-basins and the related impacts of climate variability is an essential step in managing its water resources. The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission provides a unique opportunity to monitor changes in total water storage (TWS) of large river basins such as the Nile. Use of GRACE-TWS changes for monitoring the Nile is, however, difficult since stronger TWS signals over the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) and the Red Sea obscure those from smaller sub-basins making their analysis difficult to undertake. To mitigate this problem, this study employed Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to extract statistically independent TWS patterns over the sub-basins from GRACE and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model. Monthly precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) over the entire Nile Basin are also analysed by ICA. Such extraction enables an in-depth analysis of water storage changes within each sub-basin and provides a tool for assessing the influence of anthropogenic as well as climate variability caused by large scale ocean-atmosphere interactions such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Our results indicate that LVB experienced effects of both anthropogenic and climate variability (i.e., a correlation of 0.56 between TWS changes and IOD at 95% confidence level) during the study period 2002-2011, with a sharp drop in rainfall between November and December 2010, the lowest during the entire study period, and coinciding with the drought that affected the Greater Horn of Africa. Ethiopian Highlands (EH) generally exhibited a declining trend in the annual rainfall over the study period, which worsened during 2007-2010, possibly contributing to the 2011 drought over GHA. A correlation of 0.56 was found between ENSO and TWS changes over EH indicating ENSO's dominant influence. TWS changes over Bar-el-Ghazal experienced mixed increase-decrease, with ENSO being the dominant climate variability in the region during the study period. A remarkable signal is noticed over the Lake Nasser region indicating the possibility of the region losing water not only through evaporation, but also possibly through over extraction from wells in the Western Plateau (Nubian aquifer). {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Carrier phase observations are required for high-accuracy positioning with Global Navigation Satellite Systems. This requires that the correct number of whole carrier cycles in each observation (integer ambiguity) is determined. The existing methods have been shown to perform differently depending on the observables. Subsequently, the ratio test used for ambiguity validation was developed further including combining it with the integer aperture concept. The key challenges in using the ratio test are the existence of biases in float solutions and stochastic dependence between the two elements of the ratio. The current methods either make assumptions of independence and nonexistence of biases or use simulations together with the bias-free assumption. We propose a new method taking into account both challenges which result in an unknown distribution of the ratio test statistic. A doubly non-central F distribution (DNCF) is proposed for the determination of threshold. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of DNCF over-bounds the CDF of ratio test statistic distribution in case there is a bias in the float solution and a correlation between the two elements of the ratio. The Precise Point Positioning (PPP) method with products from CNES and measurement data from 10 NOAA stations are used to verify the proposed method. The test results show that the proposed method improves the performance of ambiguity resolution achieving a lower rate of wrong fixing than current state of the art.},

abstract = {GFZ Potsdam and GRGS Toulouse have a long-time close cooperation in the field of global gravity field determination. Here we focus on (1) GOCE gravity field determination and (2) computation of high resolution combined gravity field models. Such data products play a fundamental role in geodesy and Earth sciences, ranging from practical purposes, like precise orbit determination, to scientific applications, like investigations of the density structure of the Earth's interior. Here we present our combined gravity field model EIGEN-6C4 which is the fourth release of EIGEN-6C (EIGEN = European Improved Gravity model of the Earth by New techniques). The first release of EIGEN-6C, published in 2011, was the first global combined gravity field model containing GOCE data. It was computed from a combination of LAGEOS, GRACE and GOCE data, augmented with DTU10 surface gravity data, and it is complete to degree and order 1440 (corresponding to 14 km spatial resolution). The combination of the different data types has been done on the basis of full normal equations up to maximum degree/order 370. The spherical harmonic coefficients of the shorter wavelengths were obtained from a block diagonal normal equation from the terrestrial data only. The subsequent releases EIGEN-6C2 (2012) and EIGEN-6C3stat (2013) were complete to degree and order 1949 (corresponding to approx. 10 km spatial resolution) and comprise extended measurement time spans for the LAGEOS/GRACE as well as for the GOCE data. Now we present the new release EIGEN-6C4. This time variable combined gravity field model is again developed to degree and order 1949 and comprises the new GRACE Release 03 from GRGS and gradiometer data almost of the entire GOCE mission (Sept. 2009-Sept. 2013). Our combination of GRACE and GOCE data allows the construction of an accurate satellite-only contribution to the final combined model up to degree and order 260, where the GOCE gradiometer data contribute only for degrees upwards of 100. This is achieved through filtering of the GOCE observation equations, which is necessary because of the degraded gradiometer performance outside the measurement bandwidth. Consequently, surface data normal equations are combined with the satellite normal equations at a higher degree than formerly applied before the GOCE launch (for instance at degree 70 in EIGEN-5C). The comparison of test results (orbit computation, GPS leveling, geostrophic current speeds) of this latest EIGEN model with GOCE-only models, EGM2008, GGM03 and GRACE-ITG2010S demonstrates the gain in accuracy at high degrees, while its performance is identical to recent GRACE-only model for the low degrees. Compared to the precursor releases of EIGEN-6 this new release shows a general improvement. EIGEN-6C4 is available at the ICGEM data base at GFZ Potsdam via http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de The GOCE processing within this work was done in the framework of the European GOCE Gravity Consortium (EGG-C) under ESA contract within the ESA GOCE High Level Processing Facility (GOCE-HPF).},

Westward flows are observed from the early morning through afternoon hours, while eastward flows peak in the evening. A semidiurnal harmonic is also present, with magnitudes that are approximately one third of the diurnal harmonic. The time mean wind indicates westward winds over much of the globe, with weak superrotation (+E, or eastward winds) that is symmetric about the equator during equinox, and confined to the winter hemisphere at solstice. Diurnal and time-mean CHAMP winds agree fairly well with the Whole Atmosphere Model. Some differences are observed in the semidiurnal and higher-order tidal winds, that underscore the challenges of modeling the sources, sinks and mean wind effects upon tides between the surface and 400 km.},

Findings include the following: (1) large sectors of Africa are undergoing statistically significant TWS variations (+. 44. mm/yr to -15. mm/yr) due to natural and anthropogenic causes; (2) warming of the tropical Atlantic Ocean apparently intensified Atlantic monsoons and increased precipitation and TWS over western and central Africa; (3) warming in the central Indian Ocean decreased precipitation and TWS over eastern Africa; (4) the high frequency of flooding events increased TWS over the Zambezi and Okavango basins; (5) extraction of fossil groundwater decreased TWS over the Saharan aquifers; (6) deforestation decreased TWS in three subbasins (Ubangi, Congo, and Sangha) of the Congo River Basin; and (7) the construction of dams increased TWS in the Blue Nile and Atbara subbasins. Given the 10. years of monthly GRACE data acquired on the subbasin scale across the globe, as well as the plans underway for deployment of a GRACE-FO and GRACE-II, using GRACE-derived TWS data should be considered an alternative, viable index for measuring temporal and spatial variations in water availability. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Hinderer2014,
abstract = {We investigate in this paper various approaches to correct gravity changes for the effect of atmospheric pressure changes. Two specific locations are considered: Strasbourg (France) as mid-latitude station, where regular pressure fronts occur and Djougou (Benin) as equatorial station with large thermally-driven S1 and S2 waves of planetary extent. We first review the classical approaches based on a constant or frequency-dependent admittance using only local pressure and gravity data. We consider then a model of atmospheric loading and show the barometric admittance in terms of elastic, Newtonian and total load, as a function of the distance from the station. We consider both a 2D pressure model (surface loading) and a 2.5D model, where the density decreases with height (standard atmosphere). Assuming horizontal advection in the atmospheric dynamics, we convert this spatially-dependent admittance into a frequency-dependent admittance. Using global pressure data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) at about 12km spatial resolution and 3hour sampling, we compute the model-predicted pressure admittance for Djougou and Strasbourg and we simulate the frequency dependence inferred from gravity and pressure observations below 4 cycle per day. A long gravity and pressure data set (1996-2013) from Strasbourg is used to investigate the low frequency part of the pressure admittance while a common 2.5 year data set (August 2010- February 2013) for Strasbourg and Djougou is then analyzed to investigate the high frequency part of the admittance. In both cases, our results are in close agreement with the predictions inferred from an atmospheric 2.5 D loading model with a distance-time relationship due to horizontal advection. The frequency dependence of the barometric admittance is explained by the competing contributions of Newtonian attraction and elastic surface deformation according to the distance from the gravimeter. In the far field (low frequencies), the magnitude of the admittance decreases with frequency because of the combined elasticity effect and Newtonian attraction (when the atmosphere is below the horizon) while, on the contrary, in the near field (high frequencies), elasticity becomes negligible and the pressure admittance mainly decreases with increasing frequency because of the decreasing attraction effect of the atmospheric masses inside the cylindrical pressure cell centered on the sensor location of decreasing radius. In the last part, we show that there is variability in time in the pressure admittance for both stations.},

The differences between geopotential numbers and normal heights in mean and zero tidal system are examined. For data source, four levelling lines from the National First Order Levelling Network are used. In addition, a comparison between the calculated normal heights and the official data published in the “Catalogue of the National First Order Levelling Network Benchmarks in European Vertical Reference System 2007” is made.

abstract = {Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique as an absolute positioning method requires modeling of effects that influence observations. One of the effects is a displacement of the measurement location due to ocean mass gravitational attraction - ocean tides loading (OTL). The model recommended by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is FES2004. The paper focuses on impact of applying the particular OTL model on PPP processing. The analysis is based on processing of observations from 24 globally distributed permanent stations and time span of 50 days. The analysis bases on processing intervals from 1 to 24 hours. In addition, the amplitudes of the loads in Poland are evaluated. The OTL model is location dependent, thus the importance of applying this model depends on the location environment. As the PPP is an absolute method, the loads cumulate and transfer nearly directly to the positioning solution. Consequently, for short observation intervals and small loads the application of the model does not play an important role. For the analysed station with high amplitudes of the loads the relative and absolute improvement, of the solution was the highest for height component. By applying the model, the solution improved by 19% or 7.3 mm (as for RMS and 8 hour interval). The distinct improvement for convergence exists for vertical component and threshold below 5 cm. For Poland the vertical component loads were about 5 times smaller and the highest improvement for the analysed station was 3.7% for 4 hour interval and vertical component.},

abstract = {A method for directly establishing a linearized dynamics model of relative motion for a satellite formation flying on an arbitrary elliptical reference orbit is presented. The proposed linearized dynamics model of relative motion is intuitive and favorable to be utilized for designing formation control system, implementing guidance algorithm, and analyzing optimization problems etc. An analytical solution for the radius of a reference orbit affected by the J 2 geopotential disturbance is used to approximate the actual reference orbit rather than directly use the unperturbed standard orbit. The accuracy of the analytical solution directly affects the accuracy of the linear relative motion model of a satellite formation. Thus, emphasis is placed on deducing an accurate analytical solution for a perturbed reference orbit radius, which is analyzed by adding perturbed motion in the radial direction to the corresponding unperturbed reference orbit radius. Furthermore, by considering time-varying angular velocity of an elliptical reference orbit, the analytical solution of a perturbed orbit radius is obtained in the true anomaly domain. In order to better match the actual force conditions of a satellite formation, a perturbed true anomaly and perturbed argument of perigee are adopted and substituted into the gradient of the J2 disturbance force. Simulation results indicate the analytical solution for the radius of a perturbed elliptical reference orbit is accurate, and the proposed linear dynamics model of relative motion can track the high-fidelity simulated relative motion more accurately than previously proposed dynamics models, even for an elliptical reference orbit with high eccentricity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The gravity observations of the satellite GOCE have a global homogeneous coverage and precision. This data set constitutes an independent new tool to control the quality of terrestrial gravity data. Terrestrial data reach higher resolution and precision, but can be affected by errors due to factors such as different vertical geodetic datums, wrong position in latitude and longitude, geodynamic effects and gravimeter drift, which tends to accumulate over long distances. Terrestrial data recover gravity signals at shorter wavelengths compared to the GOCE satellite, but the average gravity anomaly values can be compared to the GOCE derived values which are bandlimited to lower frequencies. We consider the area of the Amazon Craton, and in particular the Solim{\~{o}}es, Amazon and Parnaiba Basins, and part of the Tocantins and S{\~{a}}o Francisco Provinces in Brazil, to estimate the systematic errors in terrestrial gravity data. We calculate the average terrestrial gravity anomaly by spatial averages applying Gaussian, inverse distance and simple averages, which allows to compare the long-and medium-wavelength part of the terrestrial gravity anomalies with the gravity field derived from GOCE. We also consider the combined satellite-terrestrial model EGM2008 up to degree and order 250 (i.e. maximum expansion from satellite GOCE). The results show that the systematic errors range from about −28.1 to 25.2 mGal with a standard deviation value of 6.4 mGal. The mean value over the study area is about zero, obtaining 0.27 mGal difference between the Gaussian average of the terrestrial gravity data and the gravity data from the GOCE satellite-only model and is smaller than the commission error associated to the geopotential model. Also, we verified that 64.8 per cent of the study area does not present systematic errors, as their difference is within the commission error of 5.1 mGal of the GOCE model in the harmonic expansion up to degree 250. The comparison of the terrestrial data with the model EGM2008 gives slightly smaller differences, which can be attributed to the fact that the EGM2008 contains terrestrial data. The results vary only slightly according to the type of averaging used, with improved values for the Gaussian average. The analysis also shows where the terrestrial data are scarce and require an improvement in data coverage in order to correctly represent the gravity field. The method we propose can be directly used to control other gravity databases and constitutes a tool for the quality assessment of terrestrial gravity observations. Global geopotential models (GGMs) make use of spatially aver-aged terrestrial data in order to include short-wavelength spheri-cal harmonic coefficients and to improve estimates of the Earth's gravity field (Jekeli 1981; Wahr et al. 1998; Tapley et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2006). In this work we will use the Gaussian av-eraging function (Jekeli 1981), inverse distance weighting and a simple average to analyse the available terrestrial gravity data in the Amazon Basin area, Brazil, in order to compare them with the satellite-only and mixed satellite-terrestrial geopotential models. The terrestrial data allow to have detailed and accu-rate information about the short wavelengths of the gravity field, and we can estimate a mean gravity anomaly corresponding to the long wavelengths, comparable to the resolution of satellite observations.},

abstract = {An approach to handle stationary colored noise in least-squares problems in the presence of data gaps is presented. The presence of colored noise implies that a non-diagonal covariance matrix has to be inverted. The problem is reduced to the solution of systems of linear equations with the covariance matrix as equation matrix. Each system is solved using a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method. An ARMA representation of the colored noise is used both to design an efficient pre-conditioner and to compute the product of the covariance matrix with a vector. This results in an algorithm that has a numerical complexity of O(N) operations, where N is the number of observations. This makes the algorithm particularly suited for large least-squares problems. It is shown that the approach works perfectly in the sense that no edge effects show up and no observations have to be thrown away.},

abstract = {The planetary and lunar ephemerides DE430 and DE431 are generated by fitting numerically integrated orbits of the Moon and planets to observations. The present-day lunar orbit is known to submeter accuracy through fitting lunar laser ranging data with an updated lunar gravity field from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission. The orbits of the inner planets are known to subkilometer accuracy through fitting radio tracking measurements of spacecraft in orbit about them. Very long baseline interfer- ometry measurements of spacecraft at Mars allow the orientation of the ephemeris to be tied to the International Celestial Reference Frame with an accuracy of 0′′.0002. This orien- tation is the limiting error source for the orbits of the terrestrial planets, and corresponds to orbit uncertainties of a few hundred meters. The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are determined to accuracies of tens of kilometers as a result of fitting spacecraft tracking data. The orbits of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are determined primarily from astrometric observations, for which measurement uncertainties due to the Earth's atmosphere, combined with star catalog uncertainties, limit position accuracies to several thousand kilometers. DE430 and DE431 differ in their integrated time span and lunar dynamical modeling. The dynamical model for DE430 included a damping term between the Moon's liquid core and solid man- tle that gives the best fit to lunar laser ranging data but that is not suitable for backward integration of more than a few centuries. The ephemeris DE431 is similar to DE430 but was fit without the core/mantle damping term, so the lunar orbit is less accurate than in DE430 for times near the current epoch, but is more suitable for times more than a few centuries in the past. DE431 is a longer integration (covering years –13,200 to +17,191) than DE430 (covering years 1550 to 2650).},

abstract = {Spherical harmonic transformation is of practical interest in geodesy for transformation of globally distributed quantities such as gravity between space and frequency domains. The increasing spatial resolution of the latest and forthcoming gravitational models pose true computational challenges for classical algorithms since serious numerical instabilities arise during the computation of the respective base functions of the spherical harmonic expansion. A possible solution is the evaluation of the associated Legendre functions in the Fourier domain where numerical instabilities can be circumvented by an independent frequency-wise scaling of numerical coefficients into a numerically suitable double precision range. It is then rather straightforward to commit global fast data transformation into the Fourier domain and to evaluate subsequently spherical harmonic coefficients. For the inverse, the computation of respective Fourier coefficients from a given spherical harmonic model is performed as an inverse Fast Fourier Transform into globally distributed data points. The two-step formulation turns out to be stable even for very high resolutions as well as efficient when using state-of-the-art shared memory/multi-core architectures. In principle, any functional of the geopotential can be computed in this way. To give an example for the overall performance of the algorithm, we transformed an equiangular 1 arcmin grid of terrain elevation data corresponding to spherical harmonic degree and order 10800.},

Over the Abbot region, our results resolve a previous discrepancy with elevation rates from altimetry, due to a previous 30% overestimation of ice thickness. For the Getz sector, our results are at the more positive bound of estimates from other techniques. Grounding line velocity increases up to 20% between 2007 and 2014 alongside mean elevation rates of −0.67 ± 0.13 m yr −1  between 2010 and 2013 indicate the onset of a dynamic thinning signal.

@article{Eshagh2016a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. The gravity field can be recovered locally from the satellite-to-satellite velocity differences (VDs) between twin-satellites moving in the same orbit. To do so, three different integral formulae are derived in this paper to recover geoid height, radial component of gravity anomaly and gravity disturbance at sea level. Their kernel functions contain the product of two Legendre polynomials with different arguments. Such kernels are relatively complicated and it may be impossible to find their closed-forms. However, we could find the one related to recovering the geoid height from the VD data. The use of spectral forms of the kernels is possible and one does not have to generate them to very high degrees. The kernel functions are well-behaving meaning that they reduce the contribution of far-zone data and for example a cap margin of (Formula presented.) is enough for recovering gravity anomalies. This means that the inversion area should be larger by (Formula presented.) from all directions than the desired area to reduce the effect of spatial truncation error of the integral formula. Numerical studies using simulated data over Fennoscandia showed that when the distance between the twin-satellites is small, higher frequencies of the anomalies can be recovered from the VD data. In the ideal case of having short distance between the satellites flying at 250 km level, recovering radial component of gravity anomaly with an accuracy of 7 mGal is possible over Fennoscandia, if the VD data is contaminated only with the spatial truncation error, which is an ideal assumption. However, the problem is that the power of VD signal is very low when the satellites are close and it is very difficult to recognise the signal amongst the noise of the VD data. We also show that for a successful determination of gravity anomalies at sea level from an altitude of 250 km mean VDs with better accuracy than 0.01 mm/s are required. When coloured noise at this level is used for the VDs at 250 km with separation of 300 km, the accuracy of recovery will be about 11 mGal over Fennoscandia. In the case of using the real velocities of the satellites, the main problems are downward/upward continuation of the VDs on the mean orbital sphere and taking the azimuthal integration of them.},

@article{Hughes2005,
abstract = {A summary is offered of the potential benefits of future measurements of temporal variations in gravity for the understanding of ocean dynamics. Two types of process, and corresponding amplitudes are discussed: ocean basin scale pressure changes, with a corresponding amplitude of order 1 cm of water, or 1 mm of geoid height, and changes in along-slope pressure gradient, at cross-slope length scales corresponding to topographic slopes, with a corresponding amplitude of order 1 mm of water, or a maximum of about 0.01 mm of geoid. The former is feasible with current technology and would provide unprecedented information about abyssal ocean dynamics associated with heat transport and climate. The latter would be a considerable challenge to any foreseeable technology, but would provide an exceptionally clear, quantitative window on the dynamics of abyssal ocean currents, and strong constraints on ocean models. Both options would be limited by the aliassing effect of rapid mass movements in the earth system, and it is recommended that any future mission take this error source explicitly into account at the design stage. For basin-scale oceanography this might involve a higher orbit than GRACE or GOCE, and the advantages of exact-repeat orbits and multiple missions should be considered.},

abstract = {The Empirical CODE Orbit Model (ECOM) of the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE), which was developed in the early 1990s, is widely used in the International GNSS Service (IGS) community. For a rather long time, spurious spectral lines are known to exist in geophysical parameters, in particular in the Earth Rotation Parameters (ERPs) and in the estimated geocenter coordinates, which could recently be attributed to the ECOM. These effects grew creepingly with the increasing influence of the GLONASS system in recent years in the CODE analysis, which is based on a rigorous combination of GPS and GLONASS since May 2003. In a first step we show that the problems associated with the ECOM are to the largest extent caused by the GLONASS, which was reaching full deployment by the end of 2011. GPS-only, GLONASS-only, and combined GPS/GLONASS solutions using the observations in the years 2009–2011 of a global network of 92 combined GPS/GLONASS receivers were analyzed for this purpose. In a second step we review direct solar radiation pressure (SRP) models for GNSS satellites. We demonstrate that only even-order short-period harmonic perturbations acting along the direction Sun-satellite occur for GPS and GLONASS satellites, and only odd-order perturbations acting along the direction perpendicular to both, the vector Sun-satellite and the spacecraft's solar panel axis. Based on this insight we assess in the third step the performance of four candidate orbit models for the future ECOM. The geocenter coordinates, the ERP differences w. r. t. the IERS 08 C04 series of ERPs, the misclosures for the midnight epochs of the daily orbital arcs, and scale parameters of Helmert transformations for station coordinates serve as quality criteria. The old and updated ECOM are validated in addition with satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations and by comparing the orbits to those of the IGS and other analysis centers. Based on all tests, we present a new extended ECOM which substantially reduces the spurious signals in the geocenter coordinate $$z$$z (by about a factor of 2–6), reduces the orbit misclosures at the day boundaries by about 10 %, slightly improves the consistency of the estimated ERPs with those of the IERS 08 C04 Earth rotation series, and substantially reduces the systematics in the SLR validation of the GNSS orbits.},

abstract = {Making an accurate geoid model of Greenland has always been a challenge due to the ice sheet and glaciers, and the rough topography and deep fjords in the ice free parts. Terrestrial gravity coverage has for the same reasons been relatively sparse, with an older airborne survey of the interior being the only gravity field data over the interior, and terrain and ice thickness models being insufficient both in terms of resolution and accuracy. This data situation has in the later years changed substantially, first of all due to GOCE, but also new airborne gravity and ice thickness data from the NASA IceBridge mission, and new terrain models from ASTER, SPOT-5 and digital photogrammetry. In the paper we use all available data to make a new geoid of Greenland and surrounding ocean regions, using remove-restore techniques for ice and topography, spherical FFT techniques and downward continuation by least squares collocation. The impact of GOCE and the new terrestrial data yielded a much improved geoid, as evidenced by comparison to GPS measurements along fjords, which serves as a proxy for GPS leveling data, and comparisons to new GPS leveling data in Iceland. The comparisons show significant improvements over EGM08 and older geoid models, and also highlight the problems of global sea level models, especially in sea ice covered regions, and the definition of a new consistent vertical datum of Greenland.},

This color scale also allows for correct interpretation by people with common types of color blindness, which accounts for approximately 10% of the male population and 1% of the female population. While it may be possible to obtain a better resolution with a color scale that is designed for a particular image on hand, the proposed color scale works well in many applications where the user does not have the time or resources to tailor the color scale to a specific image.

abstract = {Glaciers and ice caps (GICs) are important contributors to present-day global mean sea level rise. Most previous global mass balance estimates for GICs rely on extrapolation of sparse mass balance measurements representing only a small fraction of the GIC area, leaving their overall contribution to sea level rise unclear. Here we show that GICs, excluding the Greenland and Antarctic peripheral GICs, lost mass at a rate of 148 ± 30 Gt yr(-1) from January 2003 to December 2010, contributing 0.41 ± 0.08 mm yr(-1) to sea level rise. Our results are based on a global, simultaneous inversion of monthly GRACE-derived satellite gravity fields, from which we calculate the mass change over all ice-covered regions greater in area than 100 km(2). The GIC rate for 2003-2010 is about 30 per cent smaller than the previous mass balance estimate that most closely matches our study period. The high mountains of Asia, in particular, show a mass loss of only 4 ± 20 Gt yr(-1) for 2003-2010, compared with 47-55 Gt yr(-1) in previously published estimates. For completeness, we also estimate that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, including their peripheral GICs, contributed 1.06 ± 0.19 mm yr(-1) to sea level rise over the same time period. The total contribution to sea level rise from all ice-covered regions is thus 1.48 ± 0.26 mm (-1), which agrees well with independent estimates of sea level rise originating from land ice loss and other terrestrial sources.},

abstract = {The relative gravimeter is the primary terrestrial instrument formeasuring spatially and temporally varying gravitational fields. The background noise of the instrument-that is, non-linear drift and random tares-typically requires some form of least-squares network adjustment to integrate data collected during a campaign that may take several days to weeks. Here, we present an approach to remove the change in the observed relative-gravity differences caused by hydrologic or other transient processes during a single campaign, so that the adjusted gravity values can be referenced to a single epoch. The conceptual approach is an example of coupled hydrogeophysical inversion, by which a hydrologic model is used to inform and constrain the geophysical forward model. The hydrologic model simulates the spatial variation of the rate of change of gravity as either a linear function of distance from an infiltration source, or using a 3-D numerical groundwater model. The linear function can be included in and solved for as part of the network adjustment. Alternatively, the groundwater model is used to predict the change of gravity at each station through time, from which the accumulated gravity change is calculated and removed from the data prior to the network adjustment. Data from a field experiment conducted at an artificial-recharge facility are used to verify our approach. Maximum gravity change due to hydrology (observed using a superconducting gravimeter) during the relative-gravity field campaigns was up to 2.6 $\mu$Gal d-1, each campaign was between 4 and 6 d and one month elapsed between campaigns. The maximum absolute difference in the estimated gravity change between two campaigns, two months apart, using the standard network adjustment method and the new approach, was 5.5 $\mu$Gal. The maximum gravity change between the same two campaigns was 148 $\mu$Gal, and spatial variation in gravity change revealed zones of preferential infiltration and areas of relatively high groundwater storage. The accommodation for spatially varying gravity change would be most important for long-duration campaigns, campaigns with very rapid changes in gravity and (or) campaigns where especially precise observed relative-gravity differences are used in the network adjustment.},

abstract = {Continental water storage plays a major role in Earth's climate system. However, temporal and spatial variations of continental water are poorly known, particularly in Africa. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission provides an opportunity to estimate terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations at both continental and river-basin scales. In this paper, seasonal and secular variations of TWS within Africa for the period from January 2003 to July 2013 are assessed using monthly GRACE coefficients from three processing centers (Centre for Space Research, the German Research Centre for Geosciences, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory). Monthly grids from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)-1 and from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-3B43 models are also used in order to understand the reasons of increasing or decreasing water storage. Results from GRACE processing centers show similar TWS estimates at seasonal timescales with some differences concerning inter-annual trend variations. The largest annual signals of GRACE TWS are observed in Zambezi and Okavango River basins and in Volta River Basin. An increasing trend of 11.60 mm/a is found in Zambezi River Basin and of 9 mm/a in Volta River Basin. A phase shift is found between rainfall and GRACE TWS (GRACE TWS is preceded by rainfall) by 2-3 months in parts of south central Africa. Comparing GLDAS rainfall with TRMM model, it is found that GLDAS has a dry bias from TRMM model.},

abstract = {Retreat of mountain glaciers is a significant contributor to sea-level rise and a potential threat to human populations through impacts on water availability and regional hydrology. Like most of Earth's mountain glaciers, those in western North America are experiencing rapid mass loss. Projections of future large-scale mass change are based on surface mass balance models that are open to criticism, because they ignore or greatly simplify glacier physics. Here we use a high-resolution regional glaciation model, developed by coupling physics-based ice dynamics with a surface mass balance model, to project the fate of glaciers in western Canada. We use twenty-first-century climate scenarios from an ensemble of global climate models in our simulations; the results indicate that by 2100, the volume of glacier ice in western Canada will shrink by 70 ± 10% relative to 2005. According to our simulations, few glaciers will remain in the Interior and Rockies regions, but maritime glaciers, in particular those in northwestern British Columbia, will survive in a diminished state. We project the maximum rate of ice volume loss, corresponding to peak input of deglacial meltwater to streams and rivers, to occur around 2020–2040. Potential implications include impacts on aquatic ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, alpine tourism and water quality.},

abstract = {While it has been known for some time that offsets in the time-series of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) position estimates degrade station velocity determinations, the magnitude of the effect has not been clear. Using products of the International GNSS Service (IGS), we assess the impact empirically by injecting progressively larger numbers of artificial offsets and solving for a series of long-term secular GNSS frames. Our results show that the stability of the IGS global frame datum is fairly robust, with significant effects at the formal error level only for the Rx (and Y-pole) and Rz rotational orientations. On the other hand, station velocity estimates are more seriously affected, especially the vertical component. For the typical IGS station, the mean vertical rate uncertainty is already limited to 0.34 mm yr−1 for the current set of position discontinuities. If the number of breaks doubles, which might occur using newer detection schemes, then that uncertainty will worsen by ∼40 per cent to 0.48 mm yr−1. This error source is generally a more important component of realistic velocity uncertainties than any other, including accounting for temporal correlations in the GNSS data. The only way to improve future GNSS velocity estimates is to severely limit manmade displacements at the tracking stations. },

abstract = {Using recent improved time-variable gravity solutions from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), we estimate rates of Antarctic ice mass change for the period January 2003 through September 2006. Combined improvements in data and filtering techniques allow observation of ice loss in the northern Antarctic Peninsula (AP) and along the coast of the west and central Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) in West Antarctica. There is also evidence of ice loss along the coast near the Stancomb-Wills (STA) and Jutulstraumen (JUT) glaciers in Queen Maud Land. Apparent rates are adjusted for influences of limited spatial resolution, filtering, and estimated postglacial rebound (PGR) to obtain ice loss rates for the northern AP, coastal ASE, and STA/JUT of - 28.8 ?? 7.9, - 81 ?? 17, and - 16.7 ?? 9.7??km3/yr, respectively. This is the first estimate for the northern AP from satellite gravity data. The ASE estimate (- 81 ?? 17??km3/yr) is consistent with a previous value (- 77 ?? 14??km3/yr) using an earlier GRACE data release. These results indicate significant improvement in GRACE data quality, increased spatial resolution, and applicability of GRACE data to a wider class of problems than previously possible. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {With the successful launch of GOCE in March 17, 2009 and the continuous release of its data, new versions of GOCE earth geopotential models, based on ESA's mission, have become available through IAG's ICGEM service. This, combined with the continuous release of new GRACE-based satellite-only and combined Global Geopotential Models (GGMs) allows their use, among other purposes, for the common adjustment of the so-called GPS/Levelling and GGM-derived geoid heights. The increasing performance of the GOCE/GRACE GGMs and the improved accuracy they offer to higher bands of the geoid spectrum facilitate their performance in the combination with GPS/Levelling observations on trigonometric and levelling benchmarks (BMs). A new database was compiled recently and based on GPS measurements which were performed during a five-year period on levelling BMs. This resulted in most part of northern Greece to be covered with accurate observations within an area extending 7 degrees in longitude and 3 degrees in latitude, where common adjustments of the available geometric, orthometric and geoid heights are carried out using various parametric surfaces to model and interpret the detected differences. In this work, the performance of a local LSC-based gravimetric geoid model is investigated along with that of EGM2008 and the complete range of GOCE/GRACE/CHAMP GGMs. The adjusted differences between the three types of heights are used to assess the accuracy of the various geoid models employed (both global geopotential and local gravimetric models), while an extensive outlook is paid to the varying behaviour of the orthometric heights. Absolute as well as relative differences are determined in order to investigate the accuracy achieved by the GGMs, the improvement brought by GOCE data in modelling the long- and medium-wavelengths of the gravity field spectrum and, finally, the accuracy that can be reached when GPS/Levelling is utilized for the determination of orthometric heights. The latter is of main importance for the Greek territory, since the available benchmarks are delaminated in so-called "map-leaflets" and a common adjustment of the entire vertical network has not been carried out so far. It is concluded that even between neighbouring "map-leaflets" large biases in the adjusted GPS/Levelling and gravimetric geoid heights exist, which primarily indicate distortions in the Greek vertical datum.},

abstract = {<p>Improving the ability of regional climate models (RCMs) and ice sheet models (ISMs) to simulate spatiotemporal variations in the mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is crucial for prediction of future sea level rise. While several studies have examined recent trends in GrIS mass loss, studies focusing on mass variations at sub-annual and sub-basin-wide scales are still lacking. Here, we examine spatiotemporal variations in mass over the GrIS derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites for the 2003–2012 period using a "mascon" approach, with a nominal spatial resolution of 100 km, and a temporal resolution of 10 days. We compare GRACE-estimated mass variations against those simulated by the Mod{\`{e}}le Atmosph{\'{e}}rique R{\'{e}}gionale (MAR) RCM and the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). In order to properly compare spatial and temporal variations in GrIS mass from GRACE with model outputs, we find it necessary to spatially and temporally filter model results to reproduce leakage of mass inherent in the GRACE solution. Both modeled and satellite-derived results point to a decline (of −179 and −240 Gt yr<sup>−1</sup> respectively) in GrIS mass over the period examined, but the models appear to underestimate the rate of mass loss, especially in areas below 2000 m in elevation, where the majority of recent GrIS mass loss is occurring. On an ice-sheet wide scale, the timing of the modeled seasonal cycle of cumulative mass (driven by summer mass loss) agrees with the GRACE-derived seasonal cycle, within limits of uncertainty from the GRACE solution. However, on sub-ice-sheet-wide scales, there are significant differences in the timing of peaks in the annual cycle of mass change. At these scales, model biases, or unaccounted-for processes related to ice dynamics or hydrology may lead to the observed differences. This highlights the need for further evaluation of modelled processes at regional and seasonal scales, and further study of ice sheet processes not accounted for, such as the role of sub-glacial hydrology in variations in glacial flow.</p>},

abstract = {The refracted, reflected and scattered signals of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have been successfully used to remotely sense the Earth's surface and atmosphere. It has demonstrated its potential to sense the atmosphere and ionosphere, ocean, land surfaces (including soil moisture) and the cryosphere. These new measurements, although in need of refinement and further validation in many cases, can be used to complement existing techniques and sensors, e.g.; radiosonde, ionosonde, radar altimetry and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This paper presents the current status and new developments of remote sensing using GNSS signals as well as its future directions and applications. Some notable emerging applications include monitoring sea ice, dangerous sea states, ocean eddy and storm surges. With the further improvement of the next generation multi-frequency GNSS systems and receivers and new space-based instruments utilizing GNSS reflections and refractions, new scientific applications of GNSS are expected in various environment remote sensing fields in the near future. ?? 2010 COSPAR.

abstract = {In late 2009 to early 2010, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite pair observed a record increase in ocean bottom pressure (OBP) over a large mid‐latitude region of the South East Pacific. Its magnitude is substantially larger than other oceanic events in the Southern Hemisphere found in the entire GRACE data records (2003–2010) on multi‐month time scales. The OBP data help to understand the nature of a similar signal in sea surface height (SSH) anomaly observed by altimetry: the SSH increase is mainly due to mass convergence. Analysis of the barotropic vorticity equation using scatterometer data, atmospheric reanalysis product, and GRACE and altimeter an atmospheric reanalysis product observations suggests that the observed OBP/SSH signal was primarily caused by wind stress curl associated with a strong and persistent anticyclone in late 2009 in combination with effects of planetary vorticity gradient, bottom topography, and friction.},

abstract = {The orbital elements of a low Earth orbiting satellite and their velocities can be used for local determination of gravity anomaly. The important issue is to find direct relations among the anomalies and these parameters. Here, a primary theoretical study is presented for this purpose. The Gaussian equations of motion of a satellite are used to develop integral formulas for recovering the gravity anomalies. The behaviour of kernels of the integrals are investigated for a two-month simulated orbit similar to that of the Gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer (GOCE) mission over Fennoscandia. Numerical investigations show that the integral formulas have neither isotropic nor well-behaved kernels. In such a case, gravity anomaly recovery is not successful due to large spatial truncation error of the integral formulas. Reformulation of the problem by combining the orbital elements and their velocities leads to an integral with a well-behaved kernel which is suitable for our purpose. Also based on these combinations some general relations among the orbital elements and their velocities are obtained which can be used for validation of orbital parameters and their velocities. {\textcopyright} 2013 COSPAR.

@article{Moore2014,
abstract = {Continuous global positioning system (GPS) stations propagate biases and spurious signals into the derived parameter time series when the measurements are subject to site-specific effects, such as multipath. This is a particular problem in the investigation of geophysical and atmospheric phenomena where signals may be small in magnitude. A methodology to remove these erroneous signals from long-term time series will significantly increase the usefulness of the derived time series. This work provides the theoretical basis for use of an empirical site model (ESM) derived from post-fit phase residuals to mitigate unmodelled site-specific errors. Additionally, we also investigate the effectiveness of applying an ESM to a regional GPS network and a short baseline solution. Under most observing scenarios, we show that the ESM approach is predicted to improve the precision and accuracy of the site coordinates. However, it is important to note that we found some scenarios where the ESM can introduce a bias. For instance, when the antenna is mounted close to the ground. In this scenario, for a short baseline, we observed the introduction of a 4-mm bias in height. Use of an ESM for the same short baseline with an uncalibrated radome substantially improves the results by removing a large bias of over 10 mm in height. Similarly, application of an ESM derived from historic data yields similar improvements. This demonstrates that the ESM can be a powerful tool when applied to appropriate site-specific configurations and could potentially be implemented in routine GPS analysis for a broad range of applications.},

abstract = {Sea level rises and falls as the temperature and salinity of the water column varies, which is known as steric sea level. Sea level also changes as water mass is redistributed within the ocean or is added or removed. Satellite radar altimeters measure the combination of both effects, while the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) was designed to measure time variable gravity caused by movement of water mass. Theoretically, altimetry and GRACE data can be combined in order to compute the steric sea level variations. We test this by combining current GRACE and Jason 1 altimeter data and comparing against steric sea level observations. We will describe how to properly combine the altimetry and GRACE data, commenting on important corrections that need to be applied to each data type. Using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, we examine the leading modes of seasonal variability and find that using GRACE improves the ability to recover the dominant mode of steric sea level variability over using altimetry alone. The RMS error of the GRACE ocean mass variations is estimated to be about 2 cm of sea level at a 1000 km smoothing radius. Although this is larger than initially predicted from the GRACE mission, it is still significantly smaller than the recovered signal in several regions of the ocean.},

abstract = {In this second part, we explore the implications of the tides derived from the high-resolution, data-assimilative, nonlinear barotropic global ocean tidal model described by Kantha (this issue) in altimetric analysis and geophysical applications. It is shown that when applied to the task of removing tidal sea surface height from TOPEX altimetric records, the model performance is comparable to other global tidal models in the open ocean as measured by the reduction in crossover variances. The performance is slightly better than that of the only other high-resolution global tidal model from Grenoble (Le Provost et al., 1994). The results are however mixed in regions shallower than 1000 m and in semienclosed seas such as the Bering Sea, with the model performance slightly worse overall than the Grenoble model. Computations of total power input (and hence total tidal dissipation rate) are shown to be in excellent agreement with recent analyses of TOPEX data and geophysical observations. In addition, distributions of the tidal power input, tidal dissipation, and the power fluxes in the global oceans are shown for the two primary constituents, M2 and K1. Load tides in solid Earth due to ocean tidal loading fluctuations are also computed for the major semidiurnal and diurnal constituents. The load tides are shown to be large in the shallow seas adjacent to the coasts with high tides such as the Patagonian shelf, because of the higher resolution of this global tide model. This has potential implications in geophysical applications.},

It aims at measuring with no bias the non-gravitational acceleration of a spacecraft. It is envisioned to be embarked on an interplanetary spacecraft as a tool to test the laws of gravitation. MicroSTAR is based on Onera's experience and inherits in orbit technology. The addition of the rotating platform is a technological upgrade which allows using an electrostatic accelerometer to make measurements at low frequencies with no bias. To do so, the Bias Rejection System rotates MicroSTAR such that the signal of interest is separated from the bias of the instrument in the frequency domain. Making these unbiased low-frequency measurements requires post-processing the data. The signal processing technique developed for this purpose is the focus of this article. It allows giving the conditions under which the bias is completely removed from the signal of interest. And the precision of the unbiased measurements can be fully characterized: given the characteristics of the subsystems, it is possible to reach a precision of 1 pm s-2 on the non-gravitational acceleration for an integration time of 3 h. {\textcopyright} 2012 COSPAR.

The first common mode shows clear seasonal changes, indicating seasonal surface mass re-distribution around northeastern Tibet. The GPS-derived result is then assessed in terms of the mass changes observed in northeastern Tibet. The GPS-derived common mode vertical change and the stacked Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mass change are consistent, suggesting that the seasonal surface mass variation is caused by changes in the hydrological, atmospheric and non-tidal ocean loads. The annual peak-to-peak surface mass changes derived from GPS and GRACE results show seasonal oscillations in mass loads, and the corresponding amplitudes are between 3 and 35 mm/year. There is an apparent gradually increasing gravity between 0.1 and 0.9 $\mu$Gal/year in northeast Tibet. Crustal vertical deformation is determined after eliminating the surface load effects from GRACE, without considering Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) contribution. It reveals crustal uplift around northeastern Tibet from the corrected GPS vertical velocity. The unusual uplift of the Longmen Shan fault indicates tectonically sophisticated processes in northeastern Tibet.},

abstract = {Redistribution of mass over the Earth and within the mantle changes the gravity field whose variations are monitored at high spatial resolution by the presently flying GRACE space gravity mission from NASA or, at longer wavelengths, by the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) constellation. In principle, GRACE data allow one to study the time evolution of various Earth phenomena through their gravitational effects. The correct identification of the gravitational spatial and temporal fingerprints of the individual hydrologic, atmospheric, oceanographic and solid Earth phenomena is thus extremely important, but also not trivial. In particular, it has been widely recognized that the gravitational estimates of present-day ice mass loss in Greenland and Antarctica, and the related effect on sea level changes, depend on an accurate determination of the Postglacial Rebound (PGR) after Pleistocene deglaciation, which in turn depends on the assumed solid Earth parameters and deglaciation model. Here we investigate the effect of the uncertainty of the solid Earth parameters (viscosity, litospheric thickness) and of different deglaciation processes on PGR in Greenland and Antarctica. We find that realistic constraints to the trend in ice mass loss derived from GRACE data determine a range of variation substantially wider than commonly stated, ranging from an important ice loss of -209 Gt yr-1 to an accumulation of +88 Gt yr (super -1) in Antarctica, and Greenland ablation at a rate between -122 and -50 Gt yr (super -1) . However, if we adopt the set of most probable Earth parameters, we infer a substantial mass loss in both regions, -171 + or - 39 and -101 + or - 22 Gt yr (super -1) for Antarctica and Greenland, respectively.},

@article{King2012b,
abstract = {Recent estimates of Antarctica's present-day rate of ice-mass contribution to changes in sea level range from 31 gigatonnes a year (Gt yr(-1); ref. 1) to 246 Gt yr(-1) (ref. 2), a range that cannot be reconciled within formal errors. Time-varying rates of mass loss contribute to this, but substantial technique-specific systematic errors also exist. In particular, estimates of secular ice-mass change derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data are dominated by significant uncertainty in the accuracy of models of mass change due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Here we adopt a new model of GIA, developed from geological constraints, which produces GIA rates systematically lower than those of previous models, and an improved fit to independent uplift data. After applying the model to 99 months (from August 2002 to December 2010) of GRACE data, we estimate a continent-wide ice-mass change of -69 ± 18 Gt yr(-1) (+0.19 ± 0.05 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). This is about a third to a half of the most recently published GRACE estimates, which cover a similar time period but are based on older GIA models. Plausible GIA model uncertainties, and errors relating to removing longitudinal GRACE artefacts ('destriping'), confine our estimate to the range -126 Gt yr(-1) to -29 Gt yr(-1) (0.08-0.35 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). We resolve 26 independent drainage basins and find that Antarctic mass loss, and its acceleration, is concentrated in basins along the Amundsen Sea coast. Outside this region, we find that West Antarctica is nearly in balance and that East Antarctica is gaining substantial mass.},

@article{Harms2015,
abstract = {The static and transient deformations produced by earthquakes cause density perturbations which, in turn, generate immediate, long-range perturbations of the Earth's gravity field. Here, an analytical solution is derived for gravity perturbations produced by a point double-couple source in homogeneous, infinite, non-self-gravitating elastic media. The solution features transient gravity perturbations that occur at any distance from the source between the rupture onset time and the arrival time of seismic P waves, which are of potential interest for real-time earthquake source studies and early warning. An analytical solution for such prompt gravity perturbations is presented in compact form. We show that it approximates adequately the prompt gravity perturbations generated by strike-slip and dip-slip finite fault ruptures in a half-space obtained by numerical simulations based on the spectral element method. Based on the analytical solution, we estimate that the observability of prompt gravity perturbations within 10 s after rupture onset by current instruments is severely challenged by the background microseism noise but may be achieved by high-precision gravity strainmeters currently under development. Our analytical results facilitate parametric studies of the expected prompt gravity signals that could be recorded by gravity strainmeters.},

Combining the individual solutions can be a way to gener- ate more consistent and reliable solutions. To realize this advantage of the combined solutions, the European Gravity Service for Improved Emer- gency Management (EGSIEM) project is to produce meaningful combined gravity solutions using data from the GRACE mission for various purposes in both science community and public. As a first step to produce combined solutions, we investigated available GRACE monthly gravity solutions and compared them without and with filtering in spatial domain. Then, we se- lected suitable individual monthly solutions for the combined solutions and assessed the quality of the combined solutions. GRACE},

abstract = {Relative orbit determination is widely used in the field of autonomously controlled satellite formation flying (SFF). Currently, some traditional techniques cannot meet the strict requirement of the accuracy of relative orbit determination for certain space missions. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to design some special type of sensor to increase the accuracy of the distance measurement, which can eventually lead to an improvement in the accuracy of relative orbit determination for SFF. Two types of quantum sensors are proposed, based on the double-points quantum ranging (DPQR) and the triangle quantum ranging (TQR) schemes that utilize the second-order correlation between the entangled photons. Simulation result shows that the ranging accuracy of the TQR-type sensor is more precise than that of the DPQR-type one. Additionally, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used to estimate the relative state of the SFF, which uses the TQR-type sensor as the measurement model compared with a traditional sensor. The simulation results show that the quantum sensor is superior to the traditional one and their estimation errors of the position and velocity remain within 1 cm and 1 mm/s, respectively, at a relative distance of 1 km between the chief and deputy satellites.},

abstract = {Time-frequency peak filtering (TFPF) is an effective tool for the removal of random noise and can be used to process seismic data with a low signal-to-noise ratio. A crucial aspect of this algorithm is the choice of window length (WL) of the time-frequency distribution. Whereas a fixed WL cannot simultaneously preserve signal and attenuate noise, timevarying WLs can achieve this goal. We propose a new method, L-DVV (delay vector variance), which successfully processes non-stationary signals by using the surrogate to measure the non-linearity of a time series. This method is sensitive to random noise and can accurately recover seismic signal masked by noise. Since the linearity criterion also meets the unbiased estimation criterion of the TFPF algorithm, the L-DVV method can be used for time-varying WL TFPF processing. Analysis of synthetic and real seismic data shows that the time-varying WL TFPF algorithm is effective at removing noise and recovering seismic signal.},

In this study, we incorporate GRACE data for the first time directly into the tuning process of a global hydrological model to improve simulations of the continental water cycle. For the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM), we adopt a multi-objective calibration framework to constrain model predictions by both measured river discharge and water storage variations from GRACE and illustrate it on the example of three large river basins: Amazon, Mississippi and Congo. The approach leads to improved simulation results with regard to both objectives. In case of monthly total water storage variations we obtained a RMSE reduction of about 25mm for the Amazon, 6mm for the Mississippi and 1mm for the Congo river basin. The results highlight the valuable nature of GRACE data when merged into large-scale hydrological modeling. Furthermore, they reveal the utility of the multi-objective calibration framework for the integration of remote sensing data into hydrological models.},

abstract = {The temporal variations in the Earth's gravity field caused by fluctuations in terrestrial water mass can be inferred from changes in GRACE monthly gravity field solutions. Such methods have limited spatial resolution due to a necessary and possibly arbitrary truncation and smoothing of the coefficients. Limiting the temporal resolution to one month was necessary to solve the gravity field by a global representation. Our alternative method uses GRACE satellite-to-satellite tracking and accelerometer data to obtain the along-track geopotential differences and directly estimate the temporal gravity variations regionally. This method was tested on the estimation of hydrological mass anomaly over the Amazon and Orinoco river basins. Compared to conventional spherical harmonic methods, the spatial extent of the estimated GRACE water height anomaly achieved finer resolution and is shown to follow more closely the boundaries of the river basins and significant systematic variation could be discerned at 15-day temporal resolutions.},

Uncertainties in an asteroid's orbital and physical parameters as well as those additionally introduced during a mitigation attempt necessitate an in depth analysis of deflection mission designs in order to dispel planetary safety concerns. We present a post mitigation impact risk analysis of a list of potential kinetic impactor based deflection demonstration missions proposed in the framework of the NEOShield project. Our results confirm that mitigation induced uncertainties have a significant influence on the deflection outcome. Those cannot be neglected in post deflection impact risk studies. We show, furthermore, that deflection missions have to be assessed on an individual basis in order to ensure that asteroids are not inadvertently transported closer to the Earth at a later date. Finally, we present viable targets and mission designs for a kinetic impactor test to be launched between the years 2025 and 2032.},

abstract = {Time-variable GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) gravity field solutions are routinely exploited to derive secular and seasonal mass changes on and near the Earth's surface. However, the quantification of mass redistribution from space gravimetry is not a straightforward process. For instance, published linear deglaciation rates of the Greenland ice sheets vary from ???100. Gt/yr to ???300. Gt/yr; the discrepancies are subject to applied methodologies, the considered gravity field time-series and the period of investigation. Furthermore, in the recent past discussion has come to the fore whether the temporal behavior of mass variation might be better represented by a second-order polynomial rather than a linear regression model. In summary, the degrees of freedom inherent to GRACE analysis make the detection of mass trends to become a delicate topic. This contribution sensitizes for a more careful review of trends derived from GRACE mass-variation time-series. We point to possible misinterpretation and propose " rules" that improve the consistency of results. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

During its 10 year mission, CHAMP has sampled nearly the entire altitude range of the EIA, offering the opportunity to study these currents from above, inside, and below their source region. The Swarm constellation offers the unique opportunity to study near-simultaneous measurements of the current systems at different longitudinal separations. In this study, we present new observations of these current systems, investigate their seasonal and local time dependence, investigate the use of in situ electron density measurements as a proxy for the magnetic perturbations, and compute the longitudinal self correlation of these currents. We find that these currents are strongest during spring and fall, produce nighttime magnetic fields at satellite altitude of up to 5–7 nT during solar maximum, 2–3 nT during solar minimum, and are highly correlated with in situ electron density measurements. We also find these currents are self-correlated above 70% up to 15 ∘ longitude in both hemispheres during the evening.},

These kinematic orbits have not been contaminated by a priori gravity field information. Recovery of medium-wavelength time-variable gravity signal from champ is expected to be at the edge of feasibility. This expectation is validated by comparison to an SLR solution of seasonal gravity variations and by comparison to oceanographic and meteorological models. It is shown that the error level of monthly CHAMP solutions is insufficient for revealing these time variations.

abstract = {Computation of a new Earth's gravity field model is difficult or even impossible if without a priori information about the gravity field. It is important to understand how incorporation of this information at different stages of gravity field modeling could influence the final results. The focus of the paper is on a technique based on satellite accelerations; a version of this technique was used earlier to derive the gravity field model DEOS_CHAMP-01C_70 from a 1-year set of CHAMP data. The technique makes use of both the original kinematic satellite orbit to derive the observed accelerations, and a smoothed orbit to compute the reference accelerations and to detect outliers. Now, using the same data set, we have analyzed how sensitive the obtained results are on the utilization of the a priori knowledge of the Earth's gravity field at different data processing steps. We have found that the final model is not very sensitive on how the smoothed satellite orbit is obtained, though it is advisable that this orbit accounts for a realistic gravity field model. On the contrary, it is crucial that the orbit used to derive the observed satellite accelerations should not be smoothed. Furthermore, it is important to built an accurate stochastic model of data noise. A reasonable way to do so is to analyze the posterior residuals, which are obtained as the difference between the observations and simulations based on a certain gravity field model. The quality of this model is not crucial; it can be obtained from the same data at the stage of trial data processing, i.e. without an accurate stochastic model (at least, if the number of data substantially exceeds the number of unknown parameters). Finally, the quality of gravity field model significantly depends on the reference gravity field. In particular, the EGM96 model noticeably improves the results of CHAMP data processing both at low and at high spherical harmonic degrees. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The location of the largest slip along the fault surface coincides with gravity changes measured at the sea surface separated by three months all before the earthquake. This gravity change cannot be explained by the local gravity gradient due to bathymetry along the cruise tracks. The measured gravity changes can be interpreted either as an uplift of ocean bottom or a density increase along the fault surface of which the time scale of evolution is about three months.

abstract = {One of the main objectives of Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) systems is to support space collision avoidance activities, This collision avoidance capability aims to significantly reduce the catastrophic collision risk of space objects. In particular, for the case of the future European SST, the objective is translated into a risk reduction of one order of magnitude whilst keeping a low number of false alarm events. In order to translate this aim into system requirements, an evaluation of the current catastrophic collision risk for different orbital regimes is addressed. The reduction of such risk depends on the amount of catalogued objects (coverage) and the knowledge of the associated orbits in the catalogue (accuracy). This paper presents an analysis of the impact of those two aspects in the capability to reduce the catastrophic collision risk at some orbital regimes. A reliable collision avoidance support depends on the accuracy of the predicted miss-events. The assessment of possible conjunctions is normally done by computing the estimated miss-distances between objects (which is compared with a defined distance threshold) or by computing the associated collision risk (which is compared with the corresponding accepted collision probability level). This second method is normally recommended because it takes into account the reliability of the orbits and allows reducing false alarm events. The collision risk depends on the estimated miss-distance, the object sizes and the accuracy of the two orbits at the time of event. This accuracy depends on the error of the orbits at the orbit determination epoch and the error derived from the propagation from that epoch up to the time of event. The modified DRAMA ARES (Dom{\'{i}}nguez-Gonz{\'{a}}lez et al. -2012, 2013a, 2013b; Gelhaus, et al. 2014) provides information on the expected number of encounters for a given mission and year. It also provides information on the capacity to reduce the risk of collision by means of avoidance manoeuvres as a function of the accepted collision probability level and the cataloguing performance of the surveillance system (determined by the limiting coverage size-altitude function and the orbital data accuracy). The assessment of avoidance strategies takes into account statistical models of the space object environment, as provided by ESA's MASTER-2009 model, and a mathematical framework for the collision risk estimation as used in satellite operations. In this papers, results are provided for some orbit types, covering different orbital regimes. The analysis is done for different cataloguing capacity levels (accuracy and coverage), concluding that 5cm are to be covered at LEO for diminishing the catastrophic collision risk by one order of magnitude. For MEO and GEO regime, coverage down to 40 and 100 cm respectively allow similar reduction of risk.},

The space-time covariance function has a time-correlation distance of 1.27months, which is evident that observations between neighboring months are correlated and the correlation should be taken into account. However, most of the current GRACE solutions did not consider such temporal correlations. In our study, the artifact in the regional gravity solution is mitigated by using the covariance functions. The averaged commission errors are estimated to be only 6.86% and 5.85% for the solutions based on the space-covariance function (SCF) and the space-time covariance function (STCF), respectively. Our regional gravity solution in the Amazon basin study region, which requires no further post-processing, shows enhanced regional gravity signatures, reduced gravity artifacts, and the gravity solution agrees with NASA/GSFC's GRACE MASCON solution to about 1cm RMS in terms of water thickness change over the Amazon basin study region. The regional gravity solution also retains the maximum signal energy while suppressing the short wavelength errors. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Satellite monitoring of changes in terrestrial water storage provides invaluable information regarding the basin-scale dynamics of hydrological systems where ground- based records are limited. In the Bengal Basin of Bangladesh, we test the ability of satellite measurements under the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to trace both the seasonality and trend in groundwater storage associated with intensive groundwater abstraction for dry-season irrigation and wet-season (monsoonal) recharge. We show that GRACE (CSR, GRGS) datasets of recent (2003 to 2007) groundwater storage changes (DGWS) correlate well (r ¼ 0.77 to 0.93, p value < 0.0001) with in situ borehole records from a network of 236 monitoring stations and account for 44% of the total variation in terrestrial water storage (DTWS); highest correlation (r ¼ 0.93, p value < 0.0001) and lowest root-mean-square error (<4 cm) are realized using a spherical harmonic product of CSR. Changes in surface water storage estimated from a network of 298 river gauging stations and soil-moisture derived from Land Surface Models explain 22% and 33% of DTWS, respectively. Groundwater depletion estimated from borehole hydrographs (?0.52 60.30 km3 yr?1) is within the range of satellite-derived estimates (?0.44 to ?2.04 km3 yr?1) that result from uncertainty associated with the simulation of soil moisture (CLM, NOAH, VIC) and GRACE signal-processing techniques. Recent (2003 to 2007) estimates of groundwater depletion are substantially greater than long-term (1985 to 2007) mean (?0.2160.03 km3 yr?1) and are explained primarily by substantial increases in groundwater abstraction for the dry-season irrigation and public water supplies over the last two decades.},

This time-series is compared to a mean climatology determined from satellite altimeter measurements of global mean sea level corrected for the steric variation. The GRACE observations show a seasonal exchange of water mass with the continents of the same magnitude ($\sim$8.5 mm) and phase (maximum in early- to mid-October) as the steric-corrected altimetry. This is one of the first direct validations over the ocean of the primary GRACE science mission to measure time-variable transports of water mass in the Earth system, and it suggests that GRACE data can be used to measure non-steric mean sea level variations which is important for climate change studies.},

abstract = {8 An accurate estimation of soil moisture and groundwater is essential for monitoring the 9 availability of water supply in domestic and agricultural sectors. In order to improve the 10 water storage estimates, previous studies assimilated terrestrial water storage variation 11 () derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) into land surface 12 models. However, the GRACE-derived was generally computed from the high level 13 products (e.g., land grid). The gridded data products are subjected to several drawbacks such 14 as signal attenuation and/or distortion caused by ad hoc posteriori filters, and a lack of error 15 covariance information. The consequence is undesired alteration of data and its 16 statistical property. To exploit the GRACE information rigorously and negate these 17 limitations, this study uses the fundamental GRACE satellite tracking Level 1B (L1B) data, 18 not the post-processed grid data. The approach combines the GRACE's least-squares 19 normal equation (full error variance-covariance information) of L1B data with the results 20 from the Community Atmosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model to improve soil moisture 21 and groundwater estimates. This study demonstrates, for the first time, an importance of 22 using the raw GRACE data. The GRACE-combine (GC) approach is developed for optimal 23 least-squares combination maximizing the strength of the model and observations while 24 suppressing the weaknesses. The approach is applied to estimate the soil moisture and 25 groundwater over 10 Australian river basins and the results are validated against the satellite 26 soil moisture observation and the in-situ groundwater data. We demonstrate the GC approach 27 delivers evident improvement of water storage estimates, consistently from all basins, 28 yielding better agreement at seasonal and inter-annual time scales. Significant improvement 29 is found in groundwater storage while marginal improvement is observed in surface soil 30 moisture estimates likely due to limitation of GRACE's temporal and spatial resolution.},

@article{Baroni2015a,
abstract = {Satellite formation flying is one of the most promising technologies for future space missions. The distribution of sensors and payloads among different satellites provides more redundancy, flexibility, improved communication coverage, among other advantages. One of the fundamental issues in spacecraft formation flying is precise position and velocity determination between satellites. For missions in low Earth orbits, GPS system can meet the precision requirement in relative positioning, since the satellite dynamics is modeled properly. The key for high accuracy GPS relative positioning is to resolve the ambiguities to their integer values. Ambiguities resolved successfully can improve the positioning accuracy to decimetre or even millimetre-level. So, integer carrier phase ambiguity resolution is often a prerequisite for high precision GPS positioning. The determination of relative position was made using an extended Kalman filter. The filter must take into account imperfections in dynamic modeling of perturbations affecting the orbital flight, and changes in solar activity that affects the GPS signal propagation, for mitigating these effects on relative positioning accuracy. Thus, this work aims to evaluate the impact of ionosphere variation, caused by changes in solar activity, in success rate of ambiguity resolution. Using the Ambiguity Dilution of Precision (ADOP) concept, the ambiguity success rate is analyzed and the expected precision of the ambiguity-fixed solution is calculated. Evaluations were performed using actual data from GRACE mission and analyzed for their performance in real scenarios. Analyses were conducted in different configurations of relative position and during different levels of solar activity. Results bring the impact of various disturbances and modeling of solar activity level on the success rate of ambiguity resolution.},

abstract = {Precise relative positioning by GPS is attempted traditionally by fixing the differential carrier phase cycle ambiguities to their integer values. This approach is of high interest for formation flying satellites in low Earth orbit since it can potentially deliver relative positions with (sub-)centimeter accuracy, but at the same time complicates the navigation system hardware and software. As an alternative to the fixed solution, different processing approaches making use of float carrier phase ambiguities can be proposed. The most simple of these solutions is analyzed in the present study and it is formed by differencing the float ambiguity–absolute navigation solutions obtained with navigation filters running independently on board each spacecraft. This paper presents a quantitative evaluation of the different accuracy achievable by the two approaches. Because in typical conditions ambiguity resolution should provide a markedly higher accuracy than the float solution approach under study, a particularly challenging condition for ambiguity resolution is considered. Specifically, a scenario where the inter-satellite separation is of hundreds kilometers and the ionospheric activity is severe is analyzed. The effect of un-modeled systematic errors is addressed by using real-world data from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Results suggest that in such challenging conditions the two approaches have a similar decimeter-level accuracy.},

abstract = {In this study, a new time series of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) monthly solutions, complete to degree and order 60 spanning from January 2003 to August 2011, has been derived based on a modified short-arc approach. Our models entitled Tongji-GRACE01 are available on the website of International Centre for Global Earth Models (http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/ICGEM/). The traditional short-arc approach, with no more than 1 h arcs, requires the gradient corrections of satellite orbits in order to reduce the impact of orbit errors on the final solution. Here the modified short-arc approach has been proposed, which has three major differences compared to the traditional one: (1) All the corrections of orbits and range rate measurements are solved together with the geopotential coefficients and the accelerometer biases using a weighted least squares adjustment; (2) the boundary position parameters are not required; and (3) the arc length can be extended to 2 h. The comparisons of geoid degree powers and the mass change signals in the Amazon basin, the Antarctic, and Antarctic Peninsula demonstrate that our model is comparable with the other existing models, i.e., the Centre for Space Research RL05, Jet Propulsion Laboratory RL05, and GeoForschungsZentrum RL05a models. The correlation coefficients of the mass change time series between our model and the other models are better than 0.9 in the Antarctic and Antarctic Peninsula. The mass change rates in the Antarctic and Antarctic Peninsula derived from our model are −92.7 ± 38.0 Gt/yr and −23.9 ± 12.4 Gt/yr, respectively, which are very close to those from other three models and with similar spatial patterns of signals.},

abstract = {By delivering monthly maps of the gravity field, the GRACE project allows the determination of tiny time variations of the Earth's gravity and particularly the effects of fluid mass redistributions at the surface of the Earth. However, GRACE data represent vertically integrated gravity measurements, thus are the sum of all mass redistributions inside the Earth's system (atmosphere, oceans and continental water storage, plus solid Earth). In this paper, we apply a generalized least-squares inverse approach, previously developed by 1 G. Ramillien, A. Cazenave, O. Brunau, Global time-variations of hydrological signals from GRACE satellite gravimetry, Geophys. J. Int. 158 (2004) 813 826., to estimate, from the monthly GRACE geoids, continental water storage variations (and their associated uncertainties) over a 2-year time span (April 2002 to May 2004). Tests demonstrating the robustness of the method are presented, including the separation between liquid water reservoirs (surface waters + soil moisture + groundwaters) and snow pack contributions. Individual monthly solutions of total land water storage from GRACE, with a spatial resolution of 660 km, are presented for the 2-year time span. We also derive the seasonal cycle map. We further estimate water volume changes over eight large river basins in the tropics and compare with model predictions. Finally, we attempt to estimate an average value of the evapotranspiration over each river basin, using the water balance equation which links temporal change in water volume to precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff. Amplitudes of the GRACE-derived evapotranspiration are regionally consistent to the predictions of global hydrological models.},

abstract = {Metop-1 will be Europe's first polar-orbiting satellite dedicated to operational meteorology. As such, it marks the start of our contribution to balance a long-standing service provided by the United States from its Tiros, now POES (Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite), Programme. The first Tiros satellite was launched 40 years ago and in the intervening period the US has provided the data from this evolving series of satellites free of charge to the worldwide meteorological community. As early as 1967, Europe looked towards balancing this effort, but initially selected a geostationary satellite mission as the higher priority. This led to the development of the Meteosat series of satellites, the first of which was launched in 1977.},

abstract = {In reservoir history matching or data assimilation, dynamic data such as production rates and pressures are used to constrain reservoir models and to update model parameters. As such, even if under certain conceptualization the model parameters do not vary with time, the estimate of such parameters may change with the available observations and thus with time. In reality, the production process may lead to changes in both the flow and geomechanics fields, which are dynamically coupled. For example, the variations in the stress/strain field lead to changes in porosity and permeability of the reservoir and hence in the flow field. In weak formations such as the Lost Hills oilfield, fluid extraction may cause a large compaction to the reservoir rock and a significant subsidence at the land surface, resulting in huge economic losses and detrimental environmental consequences. The strong nonlinear coupling between reservoir flow and geomechanics poses a challenge to constructing a reliable model for predicting oil recovery in such reservoirs. On the other hand, the subsidence and other geomechanics observations can provide additional insight into the nature of the reservoir rock and help constrain the reservoir model if used wisely. In this study, the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approach is used to estimate reservoir flow and material properties by jointly assimilating dynamic flow and geomechanics observations. The resulting model can be used for managing and optimizing production operations and for mitigating the land subsidence. The use of surface displacement observations improves the match to both production and displacement data. Localization is used to facilitate the assimilation of a large amount of data and to mitigate the effect of spurious correlations resulting from small ensembles. Since the stress, strain, and displacement fields are updated together with the material properties in the EnKF, the issue of consistency at the analysis step of the EnKF is investigated. A 3D problem with reservoir fluid-flow and mechanical parameters close to those of the Lost Hills oilfield is used to test the applicability.},

abstract = {Three different environmental loading methods are used to estimate surface displacements and correct non-linear variations in a set of GPS weekly height time series. Loading data are provided by (1) Global Geophysical Fluid Center (GGFC), (2) Loading Model of Quasi-Observation Combination Analysis software (QLM) and (3) our own daily loading time series (we call it OMD for optimum model data). We find that OMD has the smallest scatter in height across the selected 233 globally distributed GPS reference stations, GGFC has the next smallest variability, and QLM has the largest scatter. By removing the load-induced height changes from the GPS height time series, we are able to reduce the scatter on 74, 64 and 41 % of the stations using the OMD models, the GGFC model and QLM model respectively. We demonstrate that the discrepancy between the center of earth (CE) and the center of figure (CF) reference frames can be ignored. The most important differences between the predicted models are caused by (1) differences in the hydrology data from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP) vs. those from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), (2) grid interpolation, and (3) whether the topographic effect is removed or not. Both QLM and GGFC are extremely convenient tools for non-specialists to use to calculate loading effects. Due to the limitation of NCEP reanalysis hydrology data compared with the GLDAS model, the GGFC dataset is much more suitable than QLM for applying environmental loading corrections to GPS height time series. However, loading results for Greenland from GGFC should be discarded since hydrology data from GLDAS in this region are not accurate. The QLM model is equivalent to OMD in Greenland and, hence, could be used as a complement to the GGFC product to model the load in this region. We find that the predicted loading from all three models cannot reduce the scatter of the height coordinate for some stations in Europe.},

abstract = {The southeast Tibetan Plateau (SETP) includes the majority of monsoonal temperate glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA), which is an important source of water for the upper reaches of several large Asian river systems. Climatic change and variability has substantial impacts on cryosphere and hydrological processes in the SETP. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravimetry observations between 2003 and 2009 suggest that there was an average mass loss rate of - 5.99 ± 2.78. Gigatonnes (Gt)/yr in this region. Meanwhile, the hydrological data by model calculations from the GLDAS/Noah and CPC are used to estimate terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes with a slight negative trend of about - 0.3. Gt/yr. The recent studies (K{\"{a}}{\"{a}}b et al., 2012; Gardner et al., 2013) reported the thinning rates of mountain glaciers in HMA based on the satellite laser altimetry, and an approximate estimation of the glacier mass budget in the SETP was 4.69 ± 2.03. Gt/yr during 2003-2009. This estimate accounted for a large proportion ($\sim$. 78.3%) of the difference between the GRACE TWS and model-calculated TWS changes. To better understand the cause of sharp mass loss existing in the SETP, the correlations between key climatic variables (precipitation and temperature) and the GRACE TWS changes are examined at different timescales between 2003 and 2011. The results show that precipitation is the leading factors of abrupt, seasonal and multi-year undulating signals of GRACE TWS anomaly time series, but with weak correlations with the inter-annual trend and annual mass budget of GRACE TWS. In contrast, the annual mean temperature is tightly associated with the annual net mass budget (r. = 0.81, p. <. 0.01), which indirectly suggests that the GRACE-observed mass loss in the SETP may be highly related to glacial processes.},

abstract = {GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) has the potential of deriving the global gravity field with unprecedented accuracy in the high resolution spectral part. The usual way is to model the gravity field by spherical harmonics up to a degree limited by the numerical stability of the recovery procedure. A disadvantage of this kind of gravity field representation is the lack of flexibility in modeling the inhomogeneous gravity field of regions with variable rough gravity field features. An alternative approach is to determine a global gravity field solution with high long and medium wavelength accuracy, e.g. based on GRACE SST observations up to a moderate degree, and improve this global solution in regions with characteristic gravity field features by an adapted regional recovery procedure. The individual gravity field features in these regions can be modeled by space localizing base functions like spherical spline functions. The advantage of this method is the possibility of adjusting the spline representation and the recovery procedure according to the regional gravity field structures and the specific data distribution. As a first indicator of a rough gravity field the structure of the topography or geophysical apriori information can be used as a criterium. The resolution of the regional gravity field can be further improved by a subsequent iteration step. If neccessary, several regional solutions with global coverage can be merged by means of quadrature methods to obtain a global solution. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate this approach. Due to the regionally adapted recovery strategies this method provides better results than calculating a spherical harmonics solution by recovering the potential coefficients directly.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has ushered in a new era for satellite measurements of the Earth system. GRACE provides monthly estimates of the time-varying gravity field, which are largely due to the redistribution of water mass in the Earth system, with a spatial resolution of $\sim$500 km and an accuracy of 1 cm equivalent water. This is accomplished via a suite of instruments including a microwave ranging system, precision accelerometers for measuring non-gravitational forces, and a GPS navigation system. These measurements are providing a new observing tool for hydrologists, oceanographers, glaciologists, and many other disciplines. These tremendous advances made by GRACE have led to an interest in launching a follow-on mission with even better performance. The spatial resolution can be improved by improving the ranging performance, implementing a drag-free control system, and flying at a lower altitude. This presentation will focus on improving the ranging performance by developing an interferometric laser ranging system that we expect to perform near the 1 nm/sec level or better over 5 second intervals, which when coupled with other mission improvements, would improve the spatial resolution to $\sim$100 km for 1 cm water equivalent accuracy. We will present our design for the laser ranging system. We plan to build an engineering model of the instrument and demonstrate its accuracy in the laboratory over the next few years. The laser system will range directly to the proof masses of the drag-free system, eliminating many of the difficulties associated with post-processing the accelerometer data on GRACE. We will also present the results of an error analysis for the ranging system, how these errors are expected to propagate into the gravity field estimates, and discuss the potential science benefits.},

@article{Schrama2007,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the effect of geophysical background model errors that affects temporal gravity solutions provided by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE). Initial performance estimates by Dickey et al. (1997) suggested a formal geoid RMS error better than 0.1 mm up to spherical harmonic degree 5. Now that the GRACE gravity models and data are available, it is evident that these original expectations were too optimistic. Our hypothesis is that this is partially explained by errors in geophysical background models that need to be applied in the GRACE data reduction, and that this effect was not considered by Dickey et al. (1997). We discuss the results of a closed-loop simulation, where satellite trajectory prediction software is used for the generation of GRACE range-rate data and GRACE orbit solutions with the help of the Global Positioning System (GPS). During the recovery step in our closed-loop simulation, we show that simulated nuisance signals (based on tide and air pressure model differences) map to a 0.7 mm geoid effect for periods longer than 3 months and to less than 0.4 mm for periods shorter than 3 months. The long-period geoid hydrology signal is at a level of 4.5 mm, while the short-period hydrology is at 0.25 mm. The long-period ocean bottom pressure (OBP) signal maps at 0.8 mm and for short periods it is 0.4 mm. We conclude that short-period effects are difficult to observe by GRACE and that long-period effects, like hydrology, are easier to recover than OBP variations.},

abstract = {Obvious seasonal crustal vertical deformation largely related to mass redistribution on the Earth's surface can be captured by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), simulated by surface loading models (SLMs), and recorded by continuous Global Positioning System (GPS). Vertical deformation time series at 224 GPS stations with more than four-year continuous observations are compared with time series obtained by GRACE and SLMs with the aim of investigating the consistency of the seasonal crustal vertical deformation obtained by different techniques in mainland China. Results of these techniques show obvious seasonal vertical deformation with high consistency at almost all stations. The GPS-derived seasonal vertical deformation can be explained, to some content, by the environmental mass redistribution effect represented by GRACE and SLMs. Though the mean weighted root mean square reduction is 34% after removing the environmental mass loading from the monthly GPS height time series (up to 47% for the mean annual signals), systematic signals are still evident in the residual time series. The systematic residuals are probably attributed to GPS related errors, such as draconitic errors, while the leakage errors in the GRACE data processing and unmodeled components in land water storage should be considered in some regions. Additionally, the obvious seasonal residual perturbations in Southwest China may be related to the leakage errors in the GRACE data processing and large uncertainty in the land water storage in SLMs, indicating that GPS observations may provide more realistic mass transport estimates in Southwest China.},

abstract = {This paper aimed at assessing gravity variations as precursors for earthquake prediction in the Tibet (Xizang)-Qinghai-Xinjiang-Sichuan Region, western China. We here take a statistical approach to evaluate efficiency and possibility of earthquake prediction. We used the most recent spatiotemporal gravity field variation datasets of 2002--2008 for the region that were provided by the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONC). The datasets were space sparse and time discrete. In 2007--2010, 13 earthquakes (>M s 6.0) occurred in the region. The observed gravity variations have a statistical correlation with the occurrence of these earthquakes through the Molchan error diagram tests that lead to alarms over a good fraction of space--time. The results show that the prediction efficiency of amplitude of analytic signal of gravity variations is better than seismicity rate model and THD and absolute value of gravity variation, implying that gravity variations before earthquake may include precursory information of future large earthquakes.},

abstract = {<p>Determination of spherical harmonic coefficients of the Earth's gravity field is often an ill-posed problem and leads to solving an ill-conditioned system of equations. Inversion of such a system is critical, as small errors of data will yield large variations in the result. Regularization is a method to solve such an unstable system of equations. In this study, direct methods of Tikhonov, truncated and damped singular value decomposition and iterative methods of $\nu$, algebraic reconstruction technique, range restricted generalized minimum residual and conjugate gradient are used to solve the normal equations constructed based on range rate data of the gravity field and climate experiment (GRACE) for specific periods. Numerical studies show that the Tikhonov regularization and damped singular value decomposition methods for which the regularization parameter is estimated using quasioptimal criterion deliver the smoothest solutions. Each regularized solution is compared to the global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) hydrological model. The Tikhonov regularization with L-curve delivers a solution with high correlation with this model and a relatively small standard deviation over oceans. Among iterative methods, conjugate gradient is the most suited one for the same reasons and it has the shortest computation time.</p>},

@techreport{Thomas1999,
abstract = {The GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) mission is designed to make global, highly accurate measurements of the Earth's gravity field with high spatial resolution. Ancillary GPS occultation measurements are also to be carried out for atmospheric monitoring. In the dual-1-way biased ranging of this mission, the range between two satellites separated by 100 to 200 km in nearly polar, coplanar, circular orbits, is measured to very high precision, to within an additive constant, through the exchange of K- and Ka-band sinusoidal signals. Such biased ranging data, along with GPS L-band range and phase data, can be processed and fit over successive multiday intervals to obtain accurate estimates of the Earth's gravity field. This report approximately models and analyzes this process, from the generation of the RF signals at the two satellites through the extraction of the geopotential. The steps include generation of the transmitted signals, processing the received signals to extract high-rate baseband phase, carrying out a dual-1-way combination of baseband phase to extract high-rate biased range for each band, combining K- and Ka-band ranges to correct for the ionosphere effect, and processing the resulting high-rate biased range values to extract three types of reduced-rate observables: biased range, range rate and range acceleration. The version of dual-1-way biased ranging developed by this report improves upon previous versions in a number of ways: highly accurate satellite-timetag corrections derived from concurrent GPS data, better baseband phase extraction using highly digital processing, highly accurate USO-rate calibration derived from concurrent GPS data, an improved method for extracting high-rate biased range from baseband phase, improved filtering for extracting reduced- rate observables from high-rate biased range, and parallel extraction of three observable types.},

abstract = {The well known PUNQ-S3 reservoir model represents a synthetic problem which was formulated to test the ability of various methods and research groups to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction of cumulative oil production. Previous results reported on this project suggest that the randomized maximum likelihood (RML) method gives a biased characterization of the uncertainty. A major objective of this paper is to show that this is incorrect. With a correct implementation of the RML method within a Bayesian framework, we show that RML does an adequate job of sampling the a posteriori distribution for the PUNQ problem. In particular, the true predicted oil production lies within the band of predictions generated with the RML method and is not biased. We also apply the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method to the PUNQ data set, and show that this method also gives a reasonable quantification of the uncertainty in performance predictions with an uncertainty range similar to the one obtained with RML.},

abstract = {Since the beginning of the 1990s, sea level is routinely measured using high-precision satellite altimetry. Over the past *25 years, several groups worldwide involved in processing the satellite altimetry data regularly provide updates of sea level time series at global and regional scales. Here we present an ongoing effort supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Programme for improving the altimetry-based sea level products. Two main objectives characterize this enterprise: (1) to make use of ESA missions (ERS-1 and 2 and Envisat) in addition to the so-called 'reference' missions like TOPEX/Poseidon and the Jason series in the computation of the sea level time series, and (2) to improve all processing steps in order to meet the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) accuracy requirements defined for a set of 50 Essential Climate Variables, sea level being one of them. We show that improved geophysical corrections, dedicated processing algorithms, reduction of instrumental bias and drifts, and careful linkage between missions led to improved sea level products. Regarding the long-term trend, the new global mean sea level record accuracy now approaches the GCOS requirements (of *0.3 mm/year). Regional trend uncertainty has been reduced by a factor of *2, but orbital and wet tropo-spheric corrections errors still prevent fully reaching the GCOS accuracy requirement. Similarly at the interannual time scale, the global mean sea level still displays 2–4 mm errors that are not yet fully understood. The recent launch of new altimetry missions (Sentinel-3, Jason-3) and the inclusion of data from currently flying missions (e.g., CryoSat, SARAL/ AltiKa) may provide further improvements to this important climate record.},

abstract = {Four global ocean tide models are compared in terms of their contribution to Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment {(GRACE)} satellite-to-satellite tracking residuals. The residuals are computed relative to a comprehensive model of Earth's time-varying gravity, including allowance for mass motions in the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial hydrology, and mantle, in addition to tides. For each analyzed tide model, 4 years of {GRACE} range rate data are processed. Range and range acceleration residuals are tidally analyzed by geographic location. All four global tide models are shown to be error prone in various ways, leaving tidally coherent residuals especially in polar regions but also in some lower-latitude regions. Considerable power in the solar semidiurnal S2 tide in low latitudes suggests errors in our adopted model of atmospheric tides, which is based on 3 hourly European Centre for {Medium-Range} Weather Forecasts operational analyses. Anomalies in the {\^{I}}? 2 tidal constituent over some shallow seas suggest the presence of unmodeled nonlinear compound tides, in this case {2MS2.} Similarly, anomalies in the nonlinear M4 tide are seen if this constituent is omitted from the models. Errors in assumed seawater density may be contributing to some residuals.},

@article{Kusche2007,
abstract = {We discuss a new method for approximately decorrelating and non-isotropically filtering the monthly gravity fields provided by the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) twin-satellite mission. The procedure is more efficient than conventional Gaussian-type isotropic filters in reducing stripes and spurious patterns, while retaining the signal magnitudes. One of the problems that users of GRACE level 2 monthly gravity field solutions fight is the effect of increasing noise in higher frequencies. Simply truncating the spherical harmonic solution at low degrees causes the loss of a significant portion of signal, which is not an option if one is interested in geophysical phenomena on a scale of few hundred to few thousand km. The common approach is to filter the published solutions, that is to convolve them with an isotropic kernel that allows an interpretation as smoothed averaging. The downside of this approach is an amplitude bias and the fact that it neither accounts for the variable data density that increases towards the poles where the orbits converge nor for the anisotropic error correlation structure that the solutions exhibit. Here a relatively simple regularization procedure will be outlined, which allows one to take the latter two effects into account, on the basis of published level 2 products. This leads to a series of approximate decorrelation transformations applied to the monthly solutions, which enable a successive smoothing to reduce the noise in the higher frequencies. This smoothing effect may be used to generate solutions that behave, on average over all possible directions, very close to Gaussian-type filtered ones. The localizing and smoothing properties of our non-isotropic kernels are compared with Gaussian kernels in terms of the kernel variance and the resulting amplitude bias for a standard signal. Examples involving real GRACE level 2 fields as well as geophysical models are used to demonstrate the techniques. With the new method, we find that the characteristic striping pattern in the GRACE solutions are much more reduced than Gaussian-filtered solutions of comparable signal amplitude and root mean square.},

abstract = {A review of the research conducted until present on the subject of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) hardware-induced phase and code biases is here provided. Biases in GNSS positioning occur because of imperfections and/or physical limitations in the GNSS hardware. The biases are a result of small delays between events that ideally should be simultaneous in the transmission of the signal from a satellite or in the reception of the signal in a GNSS receiver. Consequently, these biases will also be present in the GNSS code and phase measurements and may there affect the accuracy of positions and other quantities derived from the observations. For instance, biases affect the ability to resolve the integer ambiguities in Precise Point Positioning (PPP), and in relative carrier phase positioning when measurements from multiple GNSSs are used. In addition, code biases affect ionospheric modeling when the Total Electron Content is estimated from GNSS measurements. The paper illustrates how satellite phase biases inhibit the resolution of the phase ambiguity to an integer in PPP, while receiver phase biases affect multi-GNSS positioning. It is also discussed how biases in the receiver channels affect relative GLONASS positioning with baselines of mixed receiver types. In addition, the importance of code biases between signals modulated onto different carriers as is required for modeling the ionosphere from GNSS measurements is discussed. The origin of biases is discussed along with their effect on GNSS positioning, and descriptions of how biases can be estimated or in other ways handled in the positioning process are provided.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a differential inflation scheme and applies this technique to driver estimation for the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), which is a part of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). Driver estimation using EAKF is first demonstrated on a linear example and then applied to GITM. The Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) neutral mass density measurements are assimilated into a biased version of GITM, and the solar flux index, F10.7F10.7, is estimated. Although the estimate of F10.7F10.7 obtained using DART does not converge to the measured values, the converged values are shown to drive the GITM output close to CHAMP measurements. In order to prevent the ensemble spread from converging to zero, the state and driver estimates are inflated. In particular, the F10.7F10.7 estimate is inflated to have a constant variance. It is shown that EAKF with differential inflation reduces the model bias from 73% down to 7% along the CHAMP satellite path when compared to the biased GITM output obtained without using data assimilation. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) density measurements are used to validate the data assimilation performance at locations different from measurement locations. It is shown that the bias at GRACE locations is decreased from 76% down to 52% as compared to not using data assimilation, showing that model estimation of the thermosphere is improved globally.},

abstract = {In the conventions of the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (e.g. IERS Conventions 2010), it is recommended that the instantaneous station position, which is fixed to the Earth's crust, is described by a regularized station position and conventional correction models. Current realizations of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame use a station position at a reference epoch and a constant velocity to describe the motion of the regularized station position in time. An advantage of this parameterization is the possibility to provide station coordinates of high accuracy over a long time span. Various publications have shown that residual non-linear station motions can reach a magnitude of a few centimeters due to not considered loading effects. Consistently estimated parameters like the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) may be affected if these non-linear station motions are neglected. In this paper, we investigate a new approach, which is based on a frequent (e.g. weekly) estimation of station positions and EOP from a combination of epoch normal equations of the space geodetic techniques Global Positioning System (GPS), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The resulting time series of epoch reference frames are studied in detail and are compared with the conventional secular approach. It is shown that both approaches have specific advantages and disadvantages, which are discussed in the paper. A major advantage of the frequently estimated epoch reference frames is that the non-linear station motions are implicitly taken into account, which is a major limiting factor for the accuracy of the secular frames. Various test computations and comparisons between the epoch and secular approach are performed. The authors found that the consistently estimated EOP are systematically affected by the two different combination approaches. The differences between the epoch and secular frames reach magnitudes of \n\n$23.6\sim\upmu \hbox {as}$\n\n(0.73 mm) and\n\n$39.8\sim\upmu \hbox {as}$\n\n(1.23 mm) for the x-pole and y-pole, respectively, in case of the combined solutions. For the SLR-only solutions, significant differences with amplitudes of\n\n$77.3\sim\upmu \hbox {as}$\n\n(2.39 mm) can be found.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. The European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm mission was launched on 22 November 2013 to study the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field and its interaction with the Earth system. The mission consists of three identical satellites, flying in carefully selected near polar orbits. Two satellites fly almost side-by-side at an initial altitude of about 480 km, and will descend due to drag to around 300 km during the mission lifetime. The third satellite was placed in a higher orbit of about 530 km altitude, and therefore descends much more slowly. To geolocate the Swarm observations, each satellite is equipped with an 8-channel, dual-frequency GPS receiver for Precise Orbit Determination (POD). Onboard laser retroreflectors provide the opportunity to validate the orbits computed from the GPS observations using Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) data. Precise Science Orbits (PSOs) for the Swarm satellites are computed by the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology in the framework of the Swarm Satellite Constellation Application and Research Facility (SCARF). The PSO product consists of both a reduced-dynamic and a kinematic orbit solution. After a short description of the Swarm GPS data characteristics, the adopted POD strategy for both orbit types is explained and first PSO results from more than one year of Swarm GPS data are presented. Independent SLR validation shows that the reduced-dynamic Swarm PSOs have an accuracy of better than 2 cm, while the kinematic orbits have a slightly reduced accuracy of about 4-5 cm. Orbit comparisons indicate that the consistency between the reduced-dynamic and kinematic Swarm PSO for most parts of the Earth is at the 4-5 cm level. Close to the geomagnetic poles and along the geomagnetic equator, however, the kinematic orbits show larger errors, which are probably due to ionospheric scintillations that affect the Swarm GPS receivers over these areas.},

abstract = {We use gravity implied by the Earth's rock-equivalent topography (RET) and modeled isostatic compensation masses to evaluate the new global gravity field models (GGMs) from European Space Agency (ESA)'s Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite gravimetry mission. The topography is now reasonably well-known over most of the Earth's landmasses, and also where conventional GGM evaluation is prohibitive due to the lack (or unavailability) of ground-truth gravity data. We construct a spherical harmonic representation of Earth's RET to derive band-limited topography-implied gravity, and test the somewhat simplistic Airy/Heiskanen and Pratt/Hayford hypotheses of isostatic compensation, but which did not improve the agreement between gravity from the uncompensated RET and GOCE. The third-generation GOCE GGMs (based on 12 months of space gravimetry) resolve the Earth's gravity field effectively up to spherical harmonic degree ∼200–220 (∼90–100 km resolution). Such scales could not be resolved from satellites before GOCE. From the three different GOCE processing philosophies currently in use by ESA, the time-wise and direct approaches exhibit the highest sensitivity to short-scale gravity recovery, being better than the space-wise approach. Our topography-implied gravity comparisons bring evidence of improvements from GOCE to gravity field knowledge over the Himalayas, Africa, the Andes, Papua New Guinea and Antarctic regions. In attenuated form, GOCE captures topography-implied gravity signals up to degree ∼250 (∼80 km resolution), suggesting that other signals (originating, e.g., from the crust-mantle boundary and buried loads) are captured as well, which might now improve our knowledge on the Earth's lithosphere structure at previously unresolved spatial scales.},

abstract = {Empirical models consider the physical meaning behind complex phenomena only indirectly by introducing adapted mathematical functions. In order to achieve a deeper geophysical understanding of the ionosphere the physics-motivated Chapman function can be applied to describe the electron density (Ne) structure vertically in a proper way. The combination of this function with a vertical plasmasphere representation yields a profile defined by altogether five key parameters. The Chapman function accounts for the F2-peak electron density (N0F2), the related peak height (hmF2) and the F2 scale height (HF2) regarding the ionosphere F2-layer. The plasmasphere basis density (N0P) and the plasmasphere scale height (HP) describe the plasmasphere layer. For the determination of these parameters we separate each of them into an initial (background) part that implies given prior information plus an unknown correction term, composed as a series expansion in terms of endpoint-interpolating polynomial B-spline base functions with respect to longitude, latitude and time as well as the unknown series coefficients. Our objective is the determination of all series coefficients for each key parameter. The number of coefficients to be estimated depends on the B-spline level deduced from the observation density and distribution. In this contribution we estimate the coefficients directly from Ne input data. Ne data can be derived, e.g. from occultation measurements onboard of Low-Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites such as Champ, GRACE or the six COSMIC satellites by applying the Abel transform. The major issue of our study is the estimation of the series coefficients related to the three key parameters N0F2, HF2 and hmF2 from scenarios of simulated Ne input data. Caused by the nonlinear character of the observation equation, linearization and an iterative estimation procedure are required. Examples with respect to a varying spatial and temporal observation density and different sampling point resolution are analysed. The International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) constitutes the fundamental background model providing initial data.},

abstract = {Advances in technology have allowed for the improvement of geodetic reference systems (GRSs). Relating different GRSs can be done by employing transformation parameters which may not, however, be satisfactory in certain applications due to the heterogeneous and local character of deformations caused by the procedures adopted in classical networks. Classical networks were established basically by procedures of triangulation and traverse survey, and the existence of these deformations justifies the search for new transformation methodologies. This study evaluated artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a tool for the transformation between GRSs. Frames points with known geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) in the South American Datum of 1969 (SAD69) system and in the older C??rrego Alegre system, both still in use in Brazil, were chosen for this study. The SAD69 coordinates of the frame points were transformed into C??rrego Alegre coordinates and then the computed coordinates were compared with known ones. Four tests were carried out in order to transform the coordinates. The first test involved the use of official transformation parameters and the formulas of Molodensky. In the second test, new transformation parameters were employed. In the third test new regional transformation parameters were determined, while the fourth test employed an ANN to predict the C??rrego Alegre coordinates of the check points. Results indicated that the employment of an ANN transformed the coordinates most accurately, and indicated that they can be useful in modeling deformations in classical networks. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Khan1983a,
abstract = {Accuracy tests on the most recent GEM (Goddard Earth Model) gravity models for the representation of the Earth's gravity field, using specially devised statistical techniques of comparative evaluation, show that there is steady improvement in these models with time. On this comparative basis, the accuracy of determination for the spherical harmonic coefficients of the Earth's gravity field is ∼ 100% for n = 2-6, 90-99% for n = 7-10, 55-80% for n = 11-14 and ≪ 50% for n ≥ 15, deteriorating rapidly with increasing n. The higher degree coefficients corresponding to n ≥ 15 do not seem to be determined accurately enough to be useful from a geophysical standpoint, though their cumulative contribution is undoubtedly useful for specific orbital computations. The estimated errors are 0.3 mGal for n = 2-6, 1.5 mgal for the frequency range n = 2-10, 3 mGal for n = 2-14 and 5-6 mGal for n = 2-22. These error estimates, especially the ones for the higher frequency range, may have been affected by possible errors in the comparison standards used for this evaluation. Consequently, some of the higher degree coefficients of recent GEM models may be more accurate than predicted by these tests. Due to the inherent deficiency of the comparison standards, the errors given in this paper should be treated as error estimates. The steady and progressive improvement, shown by the various GEM gravity models when tested against comparison standards 10E and WGS 72, i.e. the more recent a gravity model, the better it tests against the comparison standards in contrast to its predecessors, is remarkable, as the comparison standards themselves are several years older than the gravity models tested here. This clearly validates our choice of comparison standards, as well as the premises and predictions of our evaluation techniques. It also demonstrates the power and potential of these techniques, which only seem to be limited by the level of accuracy of the available standard of comparison. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

@article{Iorio2013,
abstract = {A realistic assessment of the uncertainties in the even zonals of a given geopotential model must be made by directly comparing its coefficients with those of a wholly independent solution of superior formal accuracy. Otherwise, a favorable selective bias is introduced in the evaluation of the total error budget of the LAGEOS-based Lense-Thirring tests yielding likely too optimistic figures for it. By applying a novel approach which recently appeared in the literature, the second (ℓ=4) and the third (ℓ=6) even zonals turn out to be uncertain at a 2-3×10-11(ℓ=4) and 3-4×10 -11(ℓ=6) level, respectively, yielding a total gravitational error of about 27-28%, with an upper bound of 37-39%. The results by Ries et al. themselves yield an upper bound for it of about 33%. The low-degree even zonals are not exclusively determined from the GRACE Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (SST) range since they affect it with long-period, secular-like signatures over orbital arcs longer than one orbital period: GRACE SST is not accurately sensitive to such signals. Conversely, general relativity affects it with short-period effects as well. Thus, the issue of the a priori "imprinting" of general relativity itself in the GRACE-based models used so far remains open. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Conklin2015a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.A drift mode accelerometer is a precision instrument for spacecraft that overcomes much of the acceleration noise and readout dynamic range limitations of traditional electrostatic accelerometers. It has the potential of achieving acceleration noise performance similar to that of drag-free systems over a restricted frequency band without the need for external drag-free control or continuous spacecraft propulsion. Like traditional accelerometers, the drift mode accelerometer contains a high-density test mass surrounded by an electrode housing, which can control and sense all six degrees of freedom of the test mass. Unlike traditional accelerometers, the suspension system is operated with a low duty cycle so that the limiting suspension force noise only acts over brief, known time intervals, which can be neglected in the data analysis. The readout is performed using a laser interferometer which is immune to the dynamic range limitations of even the best voltage references typically used to determine the inertial acceleration of electrostatic accelerometers. The drift mode accelerometer is a novel offshoot of the like-named operational mode of the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft, in which its test mass suspension system is cycled on and off to estimate the acceleration noise associated with the front-end electronics. This paper presents the concept of a drift mode accelerometer, describes the operation of such a device, develops models for its performance with respect to non-drag-free satellite geodesy and gravitational wave missions, and discusses plans for testing the performance of a prototype sensor in the laboratory using torsion pendula.},

abstract = {Crustal vertical deformation (CVD) observed by continuous GPS height time-series can be explained largely by surface loading effects recovered from both Gravity Recover and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and General Circulation Models (GCMs) data. We first show that lower degree CVD spatial spectrum due to the Earth's elastic response to a uniform surface loading plays more important roles than that of high-degree case. We then demonstrate that GRACE data with 300–400 km spatial resolution have the ability to detect 99 per cent power of global and regional CVD in spatial spectrum domain using a global frequency–wavenumber spectrum method. We can just use either GRACE or GCMs 36 degree/order (d/o) spherical harmonic coefficients (SHCs) which correspond to 500 km spatial resolution to acquire more than 90 per cent variance of total CVD modeled by up to 180 d/o SHCs at 98 per cent global gridpoints. Globally, CVD modeled by GRACE loading can explain 72 per cent annual amplitude and 69 per cent variance of GPS observed height time-series, which is better than the GCMs results of 64 per cent for annual amplitude and 41 per cent for variance. Using a three cornered hat method, we also show that the noise level of monthly averaged CVD is about 3 mm for both GPS height time-series and GRACE loading result, while that of GCMs result is only 1.3 mm. },

Over the year 2014, there were several changes in the processing of Swarm GPS data that improved the quality of obtained gravity field solutions. Although the accuracy and resolution of GPS-based monthly solutions is not as high as compared to GRACE monthly solutions derived from KBR ranging, it is interesting to have time-variable gravity from GPS orbits: (i) as the continued monitoring of mass transport processes, (ii) as independent information on time-variable gravity. We show that Swarm GPS monthly solutions can be successfully used to continue the time series of monthly gravity solutions derived from GPS tracking of GRACE satellites. Swarm monthly solutions capture both seasonal and secular variations for large regions of around 2000 km; at this resolution, the Swarm GPS orbits are precise enough to detect the geoid height variations at the mm-level.},

We present lunar gravity fields based on the data of GRAIL's primary mission phase. Gravity field recovery is realized in the framework of the Celestial Mechanics Approach, using a development version of the Bernese GNSS Software along with Ka-band range-rate data series as observations and the GNI1B positions provided by NASA JPL as pseudo-observations. By comparing our results with the official level-2 GRAIL gravity field models we show that the lunar gravity field can be recovered with a high quality by adapting the Celestial Mechanics Approach, even when using pre-GRAIL gravity field models as a priori fields and when replacing sophisticated models of non-gravitational accelerations by appropriately spaced pseudo-stochastic pulses (i.e., instantaneous velocity changes). We present and evaluate two lunar gravity field solutions up to degree and order 200 — AIUB-GRL200A and AIUB-GRL200B. While the first solution uses no gravity field information beyond degree 200, the second is obtained by using the official GRAIL field GRGM900C up to degree and order 660 as a priori information. This reduces the omission errors and demonstrates the potential quality of our solution if we resolved the gravity field to higher degree.},

The workshop was organized and sponsored by the ESA Topical Team on Geodesy Applications of the ACES Mission. . Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES) is an ESA mission based on the performances of a new generation of atomic clocks operated in space, on board the International Space Station in 2013-2015. The ACES clock signal will reach fractional frequency stability and accuracy of 1 part in 10-16 opening attractive perspectives for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity. The two-way microwave link developed for the ACES mission will allow frequency comparison of ground microwave and optical clocks at the 10-17 level. The ACES frequency reference will be connected to an on-board GPS/(GALILEO) receiver which will ensure precise orbit determination of the ACES clocks and at the same time will allow to develop applications in different areas of research. Besides fundamental physics, the geodesy part of the ACES mission is related to scientific objectives in the field of the LEO orbit determination, combined optical and microwave ranging and time/frequency transfer, determination of gravity potential using ground optical clocks, GNSS radio-occultation and GNSS reflectometry/scaterrometry. Scope of this workshop was to bring together a wide scientific community and exploit the ACES potential for applications in the fields of geodesy, Earth observation and navigation.},

abstract = {Quality description is one of the key features of geodetic inference. This is even more true if additional information about the parameters is available that could improve the accuracy of the estimate. However, if such additional information is provided in the form of inequality constraints, most of the standard tools of quality description (variance propagation, confidence ellipses, etc.) cannot be applied, as there is no analytical relationship between parameters and observations. Some analytical methods have been developed for describing the quality of inequality constrained estimates. However, these methods either ignore the probability mass in the infeasible region or the influence of inactive constraints and therefore yield only approximate results. In this article, a frequentist framework for quality description of inequality constrained least-squares estimates is developed, based on the Monte Carlo method. The quality is described in terms of highest probability density regions. Beyond this accuracy estimate, the proposed method allows to determine the influence and contribution of each constraint on each parameter using Lagrange multipliers. Plausibility of the constraints is checked by hypothesis testing and estimating the probability mass in the infeasible region. As more probability mass concentrates in less space, applying the proposed method results in smaller confidence regions compared to the unconstrained ordinary least-squares solution. The method is applied to describe the quality of estimates in the problem of approximating a time series with positive definite functions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The Earth center of mass (geocenter) time series with the sampling interval of one week are determined from Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) observations. The 3D geocenter time series were projected onto XY, YZ and ZX planes of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), thus, three complex-valued time series can be analyzed for each observation technique. The signal to noise ratio in these geocenter time series is very small and detectable oscillations are rather broadband, however, the annual oscillation can be noticed in each one of them. The wavelet transform technique with the Morlet wavelet function was applied to compute the mean and spectra-temporal polarization functions from the prograde (positive periods) and retrograde (negative periods) spectra of the examined complex-valued time series. The sign of the polarization function determines turning direction in the elliptical motion. If this function is positive or negative for oscillation with a chosen period, then this oscillation is prograde or retrograde, respectively. To estimate the significance level of polarization functions, corresponding to time series data length, the Monte Carlo experiment was performed using complex-valued white noise data. In order to detect similarity between elliptic oscillations in two different time series the spectra-temporal wavelet semblance function was computed. This function reveals that in the XY equatorial plane there is phase agreement between retrograde annual oscillation for SLR and GNSS techniques, and between prograde annual oscillation for DORIS and two other techniques. To construct a model of geocenter motion from GNSS and SLR center of mass time series the wavelet based semblance filtering method was applied. Common oscillations in the analyzed time series are dominated by the annual oscillation with amplitude less than 5 mm. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {For coastal areas, given the large and growing concentration of population and economic activity, as well as the importance of coastal ecosystems, sea level rise is one of the most damaging aspects of the warming climate. Huge progress in quantifying the cause of sea level rise and closure of sea level budget for the period since the 1990s has been made mainly due to the development of the global observing system for sea level components and total sea levels. We suggest that a large spread (1.2 {\textpm} 0.2--1.9 {\textpm} 0.3 mm year−1) in estimates of sea level rise during the twentieth century from several reconstructions demonstrates the need for and importance of the rescue of historical observations from tide gauges, with a focus on the beginning of the twentieth century. Understanding the physical mechanisms contributing to sea level rise and controlling the variability of sea level over the past few 100 years are a challenging task. In this study, we provide an overview of the progress in understanding the cause of sea level rise during the twentieth century and highlight the main challenges facing the interdisciplinary sea level community in understanding the complex nature of sea level changes.},

abstract = {An iterative algorithm for determining density and crosswind from multiaxis accelerometer measurements on satellites is presented, which works independently of the orientation of the instrument in space. The performance of the algorithm is compared with previously published algorithms using simulated data for the challenging minisatellite payload. Without external error sources, the algorithm reduces rms density errors from 0.7 to 0.03% and rms wind errors from 38 to 1 m/s in this test. However, the effects of the errors in the instrument calibration and the external models that are used in the density and wind retrieval are dominant for the challenging minisatellite payload. These lead to mostly systematic density errors of the order of ∼10-15%. The accuracy of the wind results when using the new algorithm is almost fully determined by the sensitivity of the cross-track acceleration component to the calibration and radiation pressure modeling errors. The applicability of the iterative algorithm and the accuracy of its results are demonstrated by presenting challenging minisatellite payload data from a period in which the satellite was commanded to fly sideways and by comparing the density and wind results with those from adjacent days for which the satellite was in its nominal attitude mode. These investigations result in recommendations for the design of future satellite accelerometer missions for thermosphere research. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 by Eelco Doornbos.},

abstract = {The issue of optimal regularization is investigated in the context\nof the processing of satellite gravity gradiometry (SGG) data that\nwill be acquired by the GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean\nCirculation Explorer) satellite. These data are considered as the\ninput for determination of the Earth's gravity field in the form\nof a series of spherical harmonics. Exploitation of a recently developed\nfast processing algorithm allowed a very realistic setup of the numerical\nexperiments to be specified, in particular: a non-repeat orbit; 1-s\nsampling rate; half-year duration of data series; and maximum degree\nand order set to 300. The first goal of the study is to compare different\nregularization techniques (regularization matrices). The conclusion\nis that the first-order Tikhonov regularization matrix (the elements\nare practically proportional to the degree squared) and the Kaula\nregularization matrix (the elements are proportional to the fourth\npower of the degree) are somewhat superior to other regularization\ntechniques. The second goal is to assess the generalized cross-validation\nmethod for the selection of the regularization parameter. The inference\nis that the regularization parameter found this way is very reasonable.\nThe time expenditure required by the generalized cross-validation\nmethod remains modest even when a half-year set of SGG data is considered.\nThe numerical study also allows conclusions to be drawn regarding\nthe quality of the Earth's gravity field model that can be obtained\nfrom the GOCE SGG data. In particular, it is shown that the cumulative\ngeoid height error between degrees 31 and 200 will not exceed 1 cm.},

abstract = {In a recent paper, the authors succeeded in the inference of time-variable gravity from orbit analysis of the CHAMP satellite. The authors demonstrated the potential of the adopted methods by validation against GRACE data and surface height changes from GPS ground stations. This paper presents the capability of orbit analysis for the spatiotemporal quantification of Greenland mass change trends. Based on CHAMP time-variable gravity fields from January 2003 to December 2009, we estimated the ice mass loss over the entire of Greenland to 246±10 Gt/yr. This result is in line with the findings from GRACE data analysis (223±10 Gt/yr) over the same period; the trend estimates differ by only 10%. Moreover, for some areas, the spatial mass variation patterns are in good agreement, pinpointing dominant deglaciation along the Greenland coastline. We conclude that orbit analysis of low-Earth orbiting spacecraft is suitable to assess Greenland mass balance in the absence of the GRACE satellites.},

@book{Guardia2016a,
abstract = {In this paper we consider the circular restricted three body problem which models the motion of a masless body under the influence of the Newtionan gravitational force caused by two other bodies, the primaries, which move along cicular planar Keplerian orbits. In a suitable system of coordinates, this system has two degrees of freedom and the conserved energy is usually called the Jacobi constant. In 1980, J. Llibre and C. Sim\'o proved the existence of oscillatory motions for the restricted planar circular three body problem, that is, of orbits which leave every bounded region but which return infinitely often to some fixed bounded region. To prove their existence they had to assume the ratio between the masses of the two primaries to be exponentially small with respect to the Jacobi constant. In the present work, we generalize their work proving the existence of oscillatory motions for any value of the mass ratio. To obtain such motions, we show that, for any value of the mass ratio and for big values of the Jacobi constant, there exist transversal intersections between the stable and unstable manifolds of infinity which guarantee the existence of a symbolic dynamics that creates the oscillatory orbits. The main achievement is to rigorously prove the existence of these orbits without assuming the mass ratio small since then this transversality can not be checked by means of classical perturbation theory respect to the mass ratio. Since our method is valid for all values of mass ratio, we are able to detect a curve in the parameter space, formed by the mass ratio and the Jacobi constant, where cubic homoclinic tangencies between the invariant manifolds of infinity appear.},

@incollection{Ditmar2009,
abstract = {A numerical study has been conducted in order to analyze under what conditions temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field can be recov- ered from the orbit of a satellite that is not equipped with an accelerometer. In the study, the motion of one of GRACE satellites was reproduced. A variant of the acceleration approach was used to process the simulated data. It turned out that the presence of non- gravitational satellite accelerations does not obscure temporal gravity field variations, provided that the satellite orbit (and, consequently, the set of observed satellite accelerations) is noise-free. Therefore, inac- curacies of the orbit determination is the only reason why a satellite orbit cannot be used to monitor tem- poral gravity field variations. It is shown that these inaccuracies should be reduced 30 - 100 times with respect to the level reached currently for the CHAMP and GRACE mission. Of course, a simultaneous uti- lization of data from several satellites can make this requirement less stringent.},

@article{Beutler2010,
abstract = {The celestial mechanics approach (CMA) has its roots in the Bernese GPS software and was extensively used for determining the orbits of high-orbiting satellites. The CMA was extended to determine the orbits of Low Earth Orbiting satellites (LEOs) equipped with GPS receivers and of constellations of LEOs equipped in addition with inter-satellite links. In recent years the CMA was further developed and used for gravity field determination. The CMA was developed by the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB). The CMA is presented from the theoretical perspective in (Beutler et al. 2010). The key elements of the CMA are illustrated here using data from 50 days of GPS, K-Band, and accelerometer observations gathered by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission in 2007. We study in particular the impact of (1) analyzing different observables Global Positioning System (GPS) observations only, inter-satellite measurements only, (2) analyzing a combination of observations of different types on the level of the normal equation systems (NEQs), (3) using accelerometer data, (4) different orbit parametrizations (short-arc, reduced-dynamic) by imposing different constraints on the stochastic orbit parameters, and (5) using either the inter-satellite ranges or their time derivatives. The so-called GRACE baseline, i.e., the achievable accuracy of the GRACE gravity field for a particular solution strategy, is established for the CMA.},

abstract = {NASA's mission to measure the Moon's gravity and determine the interior structure, from crust to core, has almost completed its 3-month science data collection phase. The twin orbiters of the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission were launched from Florida on September 10, 2011, on a Delta-II launch vehicle. After traveling for nearly four months on a low-energy trajectory to the Moon, they were inserted into lunar orbit on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. In January 2012 a series of circularization maneuvers brought the orbiters into co-planar, near-circular polar orbits. In February a distant (75-km) rendezvous was achieved and the science instruments were turned on. A dual-frequency (Ka-and S-band) inter-orbiter radio link provides a precise orbiter-to-orbiter range measurement that enables the gravity field estimation. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the GRAIL project. Mission management, mission planning and sequencing, and navigation are conducted at JPL. Lockheed Martin, the flight system manufacturer, operates the orbiters from their control center in Denver, Colorado. The orbiters together have performed 28 propulsive maneuvers to reach and maintain the science phase configuration. Execution of these maneuvers, as well as the payload checkout and calibration activities, has gone smoothly due to extensive pre-launch operations planning and testing. The key to the operations success has been detailed timelines for product interchange between the operations teams and proven procedures from previous JPL/LM planetary missions. Once in science phase, GRAIL benefitted from the payload operational heritage of the GRACE mission that measures the Earth's gravity.},

abstract = {The theory of Baarda's data snooping - normal and F tests respectively based on the known and unknown posteriori variance - is applied to detect blunders in errors-invariables (EIV) models, in which gross errors are in the vector of observations and/or in the coefficient matrix. This work is a follow-up to an earlier work in which we presented the formulation of the weighted total least squares (WTLS) based on the standard least squares theory. This method allows one to directly apply the existing body of knowledge of the least squares theory to the errors-in-variables models. Among those applications, data snooping methods in an EIV model are of particular interest, which is the subject of discussion in the present contribution. This paper generalizes the Baarda's data snooping procedure of the standard least squares theory to an EIV model. Two empirical examples, a linear regression model and a 2-D affine transformation, using simulated and real data are presented to show the efficacy of the presented formulation. It is highlighted that the method presented is capable of detecting outlying equations (rather than outlying observations) in a straightforward manner. Further, the WTLS method can be used to handle different TLS problems. For example, the WTLS problem for the conditions and mixed models, the WTLS problem subject to constraints and variance component estimation for an EIV model can easily be established. These issues are in progress for future publications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Geophysics of the ASCR, v.v.i.},

abstract = {Road transportation has attracted extensive attention throughout the world because of its high energy demands and numerous externalities. Sustainable road transportation has thus become a great challenge for politicians and decision-makers all over the world. There have been a series of studies indicating that appropriate pricing of fuel can be both effective and efficient for reducing overconsumption of transport fuel. However, relatively little research has been done on fuel price approaches in developing country contexts. For a country like China, where road traffic today is growing more than in other countries, there is a strategic interest to do more economic analyses of fair and efficient pricing of fuel. In this study, we present a strategic assessment of fuel pricing in energy conservation and CO2 reduction from road transportation in China, both in a retrospective and a prospective perspective. First of all, the correlation between fuel price and road transport gasoline demand, based upon data from 1995 to 2007, was examined with an econometric model. Secondly, on basis of the elasticity model, the potential reductions with respect to fuel demand and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions as a consequence of a strategic fuel tax implementation in China were examined up to 2030. The results indicate that such strategic fuel taxation can play a considerable role in steering the growth of road transport gasoline demand, and thus also Chinese GHG emissions.},

@article{Escapa2016a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Basel.The complexity of the modeling of the rotational motion of the Earth in space has produced that no single theory has been adopted to describe it in full. Hence, it is customary using at least a theory for precession and another one for nutation. The classic approach proceeds by deriving some of the fundamental parameters from the precession theory, like, e.g., the dynamical ellipticity (Formula presented.) , and then using those values in the nutation theory. The former IAU 1976 precession and IAU 1980 nutation theories followed that scheme. Along with the improvement of the accuracy of the determination of Earth orientation parameters, IAU 1980 was superseded by IAU2000, based on the application of the MHB2000 transfer function to the previous rigid Earth analytical theory REN2000. The latter was derived while the precession model IAU 1976 was still in force, therefore it used the corresponding values for some of the fundamental parameters, as the precession rate, associated to the dynamical ellipticity. The new precession model P03 was adopted as IAU 2006. That change introduced some inconsistency since P03 used different values for some of the fundamental parameters that MHB2000 inherited from REN2000. Besides, the derivation of the basic Earth parameters of MHB2000 itself comprised a fitted variation of the dynamical ellipticity adopted in the background rigid theory. Due to the strict requirements of accuracy of the present and coming times, the magnitude of the inconsistencies originated by this twofold approach is no longer negligible as earlier, hence the need of discussing the effects of considering slightly different values for (Formula presented.) in precession and nutation theories.},

@article{Bruinsma2003,
abstract = {The drag temperature model (DTM) is a semi-empirical model describing the temperature, density and composition of the Earth's thermosphere. Its first version (Ann. Geophys. 34 (1978) 9) used direct measurements of exospheric temperature and atmospheric densities derived from satellite drag data. It has later been refined (J. Geodesy 72 (1998) 161). However, both models have their lower boundaries at 120 km, which are not constrained by observations. Consequently in the lower thermosphere, the modelled temperature and density structure is uncertain. For predicting satellite orbits in the lower thermosphere, more realistic density models are required. We present a new DTM model having the following improvements: (a)Temperature and its gradient at 120 km are represented in agreement with theory and observation, using incoherent scatter radar and satellite-borne interferometer data. (b)Atmosphere explorer (AE) data, which have not been assimilated in DTM-94, are used as they cover a complete solar activity cycle. (c)The Mg II index is used whenever possible to represent the solar UV and EUV emission intensity instead of the solar decimetre radio flux, since it is more representative of solar instantaneous chromospheric activity than F10.7 is. The basic DTM mathematical representation of temperature and composition is used, with, however, some additions and modifications to take into account the variations at 120 km altitude.The temperature modelling accuracy has improved by 5-8%, and there is no model bias as a function of solar activity. The oxygen and helium modelling has improved as well, and this is demonstrated by the estimated drag scale coefficients issued from precise orbit computation. The scaling coefficients estimated using DTM-2000 are systematically closer to unity than those resulting from employing DTM-94 and MSIS-86 in the orbit computation. The minor constituents (O2 and H) modelling is unchanged. The molecular nitrogen modelling is not improved, but this is, at least partly, caused by the poor data quality.Despite these improvements, semi-empirical thermosphere models still suffer of weaknesses. First, they assume a steady-state equilibrium which is not necessarily reached in any circumstances. Second, the basic process of atmospheric heating by EUV is assumed to be represented by some indices (Mg II, F10.7), while particle precipitation is represented by an index associated to a latitude without a longitude effect (Kp), although winds that transport energy suggest this effect. Third, the data accuracy and their incomplete geographical and temporal coverage are significant sources of uncertainty. Assimilation of a long time series of data, with a complete geographical coverage, and using the Mg II index will probably increase model accuracy from the present-day RMS of 19% to 10-15%. The complete CHAMP accelerometer data set may allow the achievement of that goal after 5 years of operations in 2005. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

On-board GOCE a gradiometer, in combination with a scientific on-board GPS receiver, measures the earth's gravity field with unprecedented accuracy. These measurements have been used to compute GOCE gravity field solutions and combined GOCE/GRACE solutions. The main difference between the solutions is how they incorporate the required a priori information, which consists either of existing gravity field models or Kaula's rule for the signal variances of the gravity field. We assessed four series of models by comparing the gravity gradients they predict with the measured GOCE gradients. The analysis of the gravity gradients fits may reveal differences between the different solutions that can be attributed to the solution strategy, assuming that the measurement errors are homogeneous. We compared the GOCE gradients with existing state-of-the-art global gravity field models and conclude that the gradient errors are indeed globally homogeneous, with the exception of the cross-track gradient especially south of Australia. Furthermore, we find that the use of existing global gravity field models as a priori information should be avoided because this may increase the gradient residuals in spatial and spectral domain. Finally, we may conclude that the GOCE and GRACE data are compatible and complementary.},

Here, we present a spatially and temporally resolved estimation of the ice mass change over Greenland between April of 2002 and August of 2011. Although the total mass loss trend has remained linear, actively changing areas of mass loss were concentrated on the southeastern and northwestern coasts, with ice mass in the center of Greenland steadily increasing over the decade.},

abstract = {Since the Selective Availability was turned off, the velocity and acceleration can be determined accurately with a single GPS receiver using raw Doppler measurements. The carrier-phase-derived Doppler measurements are normally used to determine velocity and acceleration when there is no direct output of the raw Doppler observations in GPS receivers. Due to GPS receiver clock drifts, however, a GPS receiver clock jump occurs when the GPS receiver clock resets itself (typically with 1聽ms increment/decrement) to synchronize with the GPS time. The clock jump affects the corresponding relationship between measurements and their time tags, which results in non-equidistant measurement sampling in time or incorrect time tags. This in turn affects velocity and acceleration determined for a GPS receiver by the conventional method which needs equidistant carrier phases to construct the derived Doppler measurements. To overcome this problem, an improved method that takes into account, GPS receiver clock jumps are devised to generate non-equidistant-derived Doppler observations based on non-equidistant carrier phases. Test results for static and kinematic receivers, which are obtained by using the conventional method without reconstructing the equidistant continuous carrier phases, show that receiver velocity and acceleration suffered significantly from clock jumps. An airborne kinematic experiment shows that the greatest impact on velocity and acceleration reaches up to 0.2聽m/s, 0.1聽m/s 2 for the horizontal component and 0.5聽m/s, 0.25聽m/s 2 for the vertical component. Therefore, it can be demonstrated that velocity and acceleration measurements by using a standalone GPS receiver can be immune to the influence of GPS receiver clock jumps with the proposed method.},

abstract = {In preparation of the CHAMP small satellite LEO (Low Earth Orbit) mission to be launched on July 15, 2000, the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ) enhanced its high precision orbit determination capabilities in order to rapidly produce precise LEO and GPS (Global Positioning System) orbital products. These orbits shall be available at 3 hour intervals with a latency of 2 hours after the actual observation for the application of GPS atmospheric limb sounding. Rapid orbit determination will exploit spaceborne GPS high-low satellite-to-satellite tracking data, fast delivery GPS ground tracking data from a global network and on-board accelerometer data for surface force modelling. Rapidly available ground based laser ranges support the orbit determination task. Because of the timeliness requirements of the orbital products, the availability of input data in space and time for POD may be sub-optimal. It is planned to apply dynamic orbit integration and an either separate or combined adjustment for CHAMP and GPS satellites' routine rapid orbit determination. For quality control purposes and during the initial mission phase, when the available force models, in particular the gravity field model, are not accurate enough, the CHAMP orbit can also be computed in a purely kinematic/geometric approach not using any dynamical model. {\textcopyright} 2002 COSPAR.

@article{Klees2008b,
abstract = {When using GRACE as a tool for hydrology, many different gravity field model products are now available to the end user. The traditional spherical harmonics solutions produced from GRACE are typically obtained through an optimization of the gravity field data at the global scale, and are generated by a number of processing centers around the world. Alternatives to this global approach include so-called regional techniques, for which many variants exist, but whose common trait is that they only use the gravity data collected over the area of interest to generate the solution. To determine whether these regional solutions hold any advantage over the global techniques in terms of overall accuracy, a range of comparisons were made using some of the more widely used regional and global methods currently available. The regional techniques tested made use of either spherical radial basis functions or single layer densities (i.e., mascons), with the global solutions having been obtained from the various major processing centers. The solutions were evaluated using a range of computed statistics over a selection of major river basins, which were globally distributed and ranged in size from 1 to 6 million km2. For one of the basins tested, the Zambezi, additional validation tests were conducted through comparisons against a custom designed regional hydrology model of the region. We could not prove that current regional models perform better than global ones. Monthly mean water storage variations agree at the level of 0.02 m equivalent water height. The differences in terms of monthly mean water storage variations between regional and global solutions are comparable with the differences among only global or regional solutions. Typically they reach values of 0.02 m equivalent water heights, which seems to be the level of accuracy of current GRACE solutions for river basins above 1 million km2. The amplitudes of the seasonal mass variations agree at the sub-centimetre level. Evident from all of the comparisons shown is the importance that the choice of regularization, or spatial filtering, can have on the solution quality. This was found to be true for global as well as regional techniques. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2008.},

@phdthesis{TeixeiraEncarnacao2015,
abstract = {The main objective of the thesis is to identify the optimal set-up for future satellite gravimetry missions aimed at monitoring mass transport in the Earth's system. The recent variability of climatic patterns, the spread of arid regions and associ- ated changes in the hydrological cycle, and vigorous modifications in the ice coverage at polar regions have been attributed to anthropogenic influence. As such, it is important to continue monitoring the Earth system in order to properly constrain and improve the geophysical and climatic models and to better interpret the causes and consequences of climate change. Satellite gravimetric data are also exploited to further the knowledge on other geophysical processes with high societal and scientific impact, such as megathrust earthquakes, drought monitoring and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA). The primary focus of the study is to properly quantify the errors in the gravimetric data to be collected by future gravimetric satellites, in particular those related to the measurement of the temporal gravitational field variations. One source of errors comes from the background force models describing rapid mass transport processes; another error source is related to the background static gravity field model. These models are used to complement geophysical signals that are missing or improperly represented in the gathered satellite gravity data. However, they are built on the basis of in situ data that lack global coverage and, therefore, suffer from a limited accuracy (particularly in remote areas). Although the fidelity of these models is constantly improving, the satellite data accuracy is also increasing with the on-going technological and methodological advances. Determining the net effect of these conflicting trends is the main driver to study the propagation of errors in background models into the estimated models. Other sources of errors arise from imperfections of the on-board sensors, such as the ranging sensor or the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. The influence of the sensors errors is divided into the major independent contributions, with the corresponding frequency description, and assembled into a detailed noise model. The model predicts the effects of i) the inaccurately known orbital positions, ii) the noise in the inter-satellite metrology system, iii) the noise in the on-board accelerometers, iv) the wrongly-estimated Line of Sight (LoS) frame accelerations resulting from errors in the radial orbital velocities, and v) errors in the orientation of the LoS vector. The model has been validated with the help of actual Gravity Recov- ery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) a posteriori residuals, which are compared to the output of the noise model considering a simulated GRACE mission. Therefore, once the assumptions describing sensor and model accuracies are modified to reflect those predicted for future gravimetric missions, it is reasonable to expected that this noise model reproduces realistic errors for those missions. Also relevant is the analysis of the sensitivity of the data in terms of isotropy. As learned from the GRACE mission, the nearly-constant North-South alignment of the measurement direction makes the data less sensitive to gravitational changes along the East-West direction. Although formally not an error itself, the anisotropic data sensitivity amplifies the errors in the data. The sensor and model errors are propagated firstly to the gravimetric data and further to the gravitational field, in full-scale simulations of the cartwheel, trailing and pendulum satellite formations. The results are analysed in terms of i) the observation error in the frequency domain and ii) the estimated gravity field model error in the frequency and spatial domains. The error budgets for these formations are also quantified. The results indicate that the pendulum formation with no along-track displacement is least sensitive to model and sensors errors, in particular to temporal aliasing. The conducted study reveals serious limitations in the cartwheel mission concept, since the orbit errors are considerably amplified by the diagonal components of the gravity gradient tensor, while the pendulum and trailing formations are only affected by (small) off-diagonal components. The spatial error patterns provide valuable clues on how to best combine the different formation geometries in order to produce minimum anisotropy in the sensitivity of collected data. The data from the pendulum formation show some anisotropic sensitivity but the combination of such data with those from a trailing formation, such as the GRACE Follow On (GFO), would eliminate this disadvantage (as well as the low accuracy near the poles of the pendulum formation). Unlike alternative proposals for dual-pair satellite missions, such as the Bender constellation, the dual trailing/pendulum constellation would provide global coverage in case of failure of one satellite pair and dense temporal sampling at high latitudes. Furthermore, the data from gravimetric missions are shown to benefit greatly from the data gathered by numerous non-dedicated satellites. From the conducted simulations, it is predicted that the achievable temporal resolution is increased to a few days for the degrees below 10 and, crucially, with no significant level of temporal aliasing. Longer estimation periods allow for higher degrees to be estimated, with greatly reduced effects of temporal aliasing in the resulting gravity field models.},

abstract = {Precise high-resolution global mean gravity field models are needed in various geodetic-geophysical applications such as e.g. precise orbit determination of Earth satellites at all altitudes, GPS levelling, determination of ocean surface currents from altimetry or geotectonic/geodynamic interpretation and modelling. Traditionally, such models are derived from the combination of satellite tracking data describing the long -wavelength components and surface gravity data providing the short-wavelength. With the modern high precision and homogeneous data from CHAMP and GRACE a new class of high-resolution global mean gravity field models can be derived. At GFZ Potsdam and GRGS Toulouse, such advanced global gravity models are routinely produced in the framework of the EIGEN processing activities (EIGEN = European Improved Gravity model of the Earth by New techniques). In this contribution we highlight the latest results of the EIGEN gravity model products, labeled EIGEN-04 and EIGEN-05, and compare with outcomes of former analyses. Among other features like partially newly processed surface gravity data a special band-limited combination technique was applied to get a smooth transition from the long- to the short-wavelength bands. The obtained Earth gravity field parameters are an update of former EIGEN models of a resolution corresponding to a half-wavelength of 55 km and degree/order 360, respectively. The high quality value of these new models was recently appreciated by adopting the EIGEN-GL04C model as a standard for the reprocessing of Jason and TOPEX/Poseidon data, indicating the potential benefit of even further improved EIGEN combination models for the upcoming GOCE mission.},

abstract = {Gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE)-derived temporal gravity variations can be resolved within the mu gal (10(-8) m/s(2)) range, if we restrict the spatial resolution to a half-wavelength of about 1,500 km and the temporal resolution to 1 month. For independent validations, a comparison with ground gravity measurements is of fundamental interest. For this purpose, data from selected superconducting gravimeter (SG) stations forming the Global Geodynamics Project (GGP) network are used. For comparison, GRACE and SG data sets are reduced for the same known gravity effects due to Earth and ocean tides, pole tide and atmosphere. In contrast to GRACE, the SG also measures gravity changes due to load-induced height variations, whereas the satellite-derived models do not contain this effect. For a solid spherical harmonic decomposition of the gravity field, this load effect can be modelled using degree-dependent load Love numbers, and this effect is added to the satellite-derived models. After reduction of the known gravity effects from both data sets, the remaining part can mainly be assumed to represent mass changes in terrestrial water storage. Therefore, gravity variations derived from global hydrological models are applied to verify the SG and GRACE results. Conversely, the hydrology models can be checked by gravity variations determined from GRACE and SG observations. Such a comparison shows quite a good agreement between gravity variation derived from SG, GRACE and hydrology models, which lie within their estimated error limits for most of the studied SG locations. It is shown that the SG gravity variations (point measurements) are representative for a large area within the accuracy, if local gravity effects are removed. The individual discrepancies between SG, GRACE and hydrology models may give hints for further investigations of each data series.},

abstract = {The mapping function is commonly used to convert slant to vertical total electron content (TEC) based on the assumption that the ionospheric electrons concentrate in a layer. The height of the layer is called ionospheric effective height (IEH) or shell height. The mapping function and IEH are generally well understood for ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations, but they are rarely studied for the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-based TEC conversion. This study is to examine the applicability of three mapping functions for LEO-based GNSS observations. Two IEH calculating methods, namely the centroid method based on the definition of the centroid and the integral method based on one half of the total integral, are discussed. It is found that the IEHs increase linearly with the orbit altitudes ranging from 400 to 1400 km. Model simulations are used to compare the vertical TEC converted by these mapping functions and the vertical TEC directly calculated by the model. Our results illustrate that the F{&}K (Foelsche and Kirchengast) geometric mapping function together with the IEH from the centroid method is more suitable for the LEO-based TEC conversion, though the thin layer model along with the IEH of the integral method is more appropriate for the ground-based vertical TEC retrieval.},

abstract = {Within the International GNSS Service (IGS), more than 200 worldwide agencies have, for many years, pooled resources and permanent GNSS station data to generate precise GNSS products in support of Earth science research, multidisciplinary applications, and education. So far, this service has been restricted to two systems — namely, GPS and GLONASS. In recognition of the rapidly evolving GNSS landscape, the IGS has set up the Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) to explore and promote the use of new navigation signals and constellations. It will enable an early familiarization with new GNSS, identify and overcome relevant challenges, and prepare use of emerging navigation systems in routine IGS products. MGEX comprises the build-up of a new network of sensor stations, the characterization of the user equipment and space segment, the development of new concepts and data processing tools, and the generation of early data products for Galileo, QZSS, and BeiDou. MGEX is coordinated by the IGS Multi-GNSS Working Group (MGWG), which interacts closely with other IGS entities, such as the RINEX WG, the Antenna WG, the Data Center WG, and the Infra-structure Committee. The article starts out with a description of the MGEX network that formed the starting point and initial focus of the overall MGEX project. Following a description of system characterization activities, the current status of multi-GNSS data products and ongoing efforts for the development of new standards for multi-GNSS-related work within the IGS are presented.},

abstract = {Groundwater is a primary hydrological reservoir of the Great Lakes Water Basin (GLB), which is an important region to both Canada and US in terms of culture, society and economy. Due to insufficient observations, there is a knowledge gap about groundwater storage variation and its interaction with the Great Lakes. The objective of this study is to examine the detectability of the groundwater storage change within the GLB using the monthly models from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, auxiliary soil moisture, snow and lake (SMSL) data, and predictions from glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models. A two-step filtering method is developed to optimize the extraction of GRACE signal. A two dimensional basin window weight function is also introduced to reduce ringing artifacts caused by the band-limited GRACE models in estimating the water storage change within the GLB. The groundwater storage (GWS) as deviation from a reference mean storage is estimated for the period of 2002 to 2009. The average GWS of the GLB clearly show an annual cycle with an amplitude range from 27 to 91 mm in water thickness equivalent (WTE), and a phase range of about two months. The estimated phases of GWS variations have a half year shift with respect to the phase of SMSL water storage variations which show peaks in March and April. The least squares estimation gives a GWS loss trend of from 2.3 to 9.3 km(3)/yr within the GLB for the period of study. This wide range of the GRACE GWS results is caused largely by the differences of soil moisture and snow storage from different land surface models (LSMs), and to a lesser extent by the GRACE commission and omission errors, and the GIA model error.},

abstract = {There are two spurious jumps in the atmospheric part of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-Atmosphere and Ocean De-aliasing level 1B (GRACE-AOD1B) products, which occurred in January-February of the years 2006 and 2010, as a result of the vertical level and horizontal resolution changes in the ECMWFop (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts operational analysis). These jumps cause a systematic error in the estimation of mass changes from GRACE time-variable level 2 products, since GRACE-AOD1B mass variations are removed during the computation of GRACE level 2. In this short note, the potential impact of using an improved set of 6-hourly atmospheric de-aliasing products on the computations of linear trends as well as the amplitude of annual and semi-annual mass changes from GRACE is assessed. These improvements result from 1) employing a modified 3D integration approach (ITG3D), and 2) using long-term consistent atmospheric fields from the ECMWF reanalysis (ERA-Interim). The monthly averages of the new ITG3D-ERA-Interim de-aliasing products are then compared to the atmospheric part of GRACE-AOD1B, covering January 2003 to December 2010. These comparisons include the 33 world largest river basins along with Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets. The results indicate a considerable difference in total atmospheric mass derived from the two products over some of the mentioned regions. We suggest that future GRACE studies consider these through updating uncertainty budgets or by applying corrections to estimated trends and amplitudes/phases.},

abstract = {Effectively communicating the complexity of climate change to the public is an important goal for the climate change research community, particularly for those of us who receive public funds. The challenge of communicating the science of climate change will be reduced if climate change researchers consider the links between personality types, communication tendencies and learning preferences. Jungian personality type is one of many factors related to an individual's preferred style of taking in and processing information, i.e., preferred communication style. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Jungian personality type profile of interdisciplinary, early career climate researchers is significantly different from that of the general population in the United States. In particular, Ph.D. climate researchers tend towards Intuition and focus on theories and the " big picture " , while the U.S. general population tends towards Sensing and focuses on concrete examples and experience. There are other differences as well in the way the general public as a group prefers to take in information, make decisions, and deal with the outer world, compared with the average interdisciplinary climate scientist. These differences have important implications for communication between these two groups. We suggest that climate researchers will be more effective in conveying their messages if they are aware of their own personality type and potential differences in preferred learning and communication styles between themselves and the general public (and other specific audiences), and use this knowledge to more effectively target their audience.},

abstract = {In the eighties, the analysis of satellite altimetry data leads to the major discovery of gravity lineations in the oceans, with wavelengths between 200 and 1400 km. While the existence of the 200 km scale undulations is widely accepted, undulations at scales larger than 400 km are still a matter of debate. In this paper, we revisit the topic of the large-scale geoid undulations over the oceans in the light of the satellite gravity data provided by the GRACE mission, considerably more precise than the altimetry data at wavelengths larger than 400 km. First, we develop a dedicated method of directional Poisson wavelet analysis on the sphere with significance testing, in order to detect and characterize directional structures in geophysical data on the sphere at different spatial scales. This method is particularly well suited for potential field analysis. We validate it on a series of synthetic tests, and then apply it to analyze recent gravity models, as well as a bathymetry data set independent from gravity. Our analysis confirms the existence of gravity undulations at large scale in the oceans, with characteristic scales between 600 and 2000 km. Their direction correlates well with present-day plate motion over the Pacific ocean, where they are particularly clear, and associated with a conjugate direction at 1500 km scale. A major finding is that the 2000 km scale geoid undulations dominate and had never been so clearly observed previously. This is due to the great precision of GRACE data at those wavelengths. Given the large scale of these undulations, they are most likely related to mantle processes. Taking into account observations and models from other geophysical information, as seismological tomography, convection and geochemical models and electrical conductivity in the mantle, we conceive that all these inputs indicate a directional fabric of the mantle flows at depth, reflecting how the history of subduction influences the organization of lower mantle upwellings.},

As a result, the individual articles place less stress on the procedure to be followed. This procedure is clearly set out in Part III, which summarises the sequence of actions and the minimum time schedule. The doctoral defence procedure comprises a number of specific moments. To prevent either the promotor or the PhD candidate from becoming bewildered by a plethora of administrative details, this procedure has been standardised as far as possible.

abstract = {An improved version of the global hydrodynamic tide solutions [finite element solutions (FESs) FES94, FES95.2.1, and FES98] has been developed, implemented, and validated. The new model is based on the resolution of the tidal barotropic equations on a global finite element grid without any open boundary condition, which leads to solutions independent of in situ data (no open boundary conditions and no assimilation). The accuracy of these "free" solutions is improved by assimilating tide gauge and TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) altimeter information through a representer assimilation method. This leads to the FES99 version of this model. For the eight main constituents of the tidal spectrum (M-2, S-2, N-2, K-2, 2N(2), K-1, O-1, and Q(1)), about 700 tide gauges and 687 T/P altimetric measurements are assimilated. An original algorithm is developed to calculate the tidal harmonic constituents at crossover points of the T/P altimeter database. Additional work is performed for the S2 wave by reconsidering the inverse barometer correction. To complete the spectrum, 19 minor constituents have been added by admittance. The accuracy of FES99 is evaluated against the former FESs. First, it is compared to two tide gauge datasets: ST95 (95 open-ocean measurements) and ST739 (739 coastal measurements). For ST95, the root-sum square of the differences between observations and solutions is reduced from 2.8 (FES95.2.1) to 2.4 cm (FES99), a gain of 17% in overall accuracy. Second, the variance of the sea surface variability is calculated and compared for FES95.2.1, FES98, and FES99 at the T/P and the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) crossover data points. FES99 performed best, with a residual standard deviation for the independent ERS-2 dataset of 13.5 cm (15.2 cm for FES95.2.1). Third, tidal predictions are implemented for the FESs to provide along-track estimates of the sea surface variability for T/P and ERS-2. Compared to ERS-2, FES99 residuals are 11.8 cm (12.4 cm for FES95.2.1). All the accuracy tests show that FES99 is a significant improvement compared to former FESs both in the deep ocean and along coasts.},

abstract = {European Space Agency's Gravity field and steady state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) space gravity gradiometer (SGG) mission is anticipated to determine the mean gravity field of the Earth with an unprecedented geoid accuracy of several cm rms with wavelength of 130 km or longer. In a sun-synchronous, near-polar, circular orbit at an altitude of 250 km, GOCE senses not only static gravitational forces but also tides and other temporal signals resulting from mass variations of various Earth processes. These signals manifest as gravity field changes and include effects such as atmospheric loading on the Earth, ground water movement, oceanic mass variations, and ice mass flux changes. In this study, we investigate the high (temporal) frequency aliasing and mismodeling effects from ocean tides, atmosphere, and hydrological mass variations on the GOCE estimated gravity model complete to degree (N max) 300 using simulated diagonal gravity gradient tensor measurements over a 2 month data span, applying frequency-dependent noise while ignoring the high-low GPS tracking data. Various mass variation effects have been computed for N max =60. It is concluded that the power spectral density (PSD) of the considered temporal mass variations generally has less magnitude than the measurements noise over all spectral bands. Only unmodeled total ocean tidal signals are found to have errors of a few mE/Hz 1/2 maximum within the measurement bandwidth. Specifically, S 2 and K 1 tides are significant for N max ≤90, while atmosphere and hydrological affects are significantly less on the two-month GOCE mean gravity solution. The measurement noise and regularization show $\sim$15 cm RMS geoid error for a spatial scale 67 km or longer, and error due to other temporal mass variations is an order of magnitude smaller at 1–2 cm RMS. Future simulation studies include further assessment of GOCE gravity field errors at long wavelength components when high-low GPS tracking is included and for the cases of tidal perturbations at spatial frequencies shorter than N max =60.},

abstract = {GRACE, designed to monitor temporal variations in the fluid mass at the surface of the Earth, is still operating and providing invaluable data 7 years after launch. One hundred and ninety-nine satellite-only geopotential solutions to degree and order 50 were recomputed per 10-day interval for the period 29 July 2002–27 May 2008 using an improved data editing and solution regularization procedure. These release 2 solutions are significantly improved compared to release 1 solutions, the noise over deserts and oceans in the form of North–South striping being reduced by 20–40%. This is thanks to the tailored regularization of each individual Stokes coefficient applied in the solution procedure, and to a time-variable reference model containing mean annual, semiannual and secular variations for degrees 2–50 towards which the variations per 10-day solution are constrained. It may attenuate signals of the order of a few percent, whereas this always occurs when applying a Gaussian smoother even with a half-width smoothing radius as small as 300 km. The uncertainty of an individual point in the time series of a basin expressed in equivalent water height inferred from the 10-day solutions is approximately 20 mm. Comparison of these 10-day solutions to monthly GRACE project solutions (CSR, GFZ and JPL) shows substantial differences. Even for the largest basin, the Amazon, a 15% difference in annual amplitude is found between CNES release 2 and CSR versus GFZ and JPL. The mass-loss estimates for East and West Greenland vary by 100%. Sometimes clear outliers are detected in the GFZ and JPL solutions when a particular basin is studied, which have to be eliminated. In view of the large differences detected between the time series for specific basins, it is hazardous to draw conclusions based on a single solution.},

@article{Polyakov2015a,
abstract = {The possibility of earthquake prediction is one of the key open questions in modern geophysics. We propose an approach based on the analysis of common short-term candidate precursors (2 weeks to 3 months prior to strong earthquake) with the subsequent processing of brain activity signals generated in specific types of rats (kept in laboratory settings) who reportedly sense an impending earthquake a few days prior to the event. We illustrate the identification of short-term precursors using the groundwater sodium-ion concentration data in the time frame from 2010 to 2014 (a major earthquake occurred on 28 February 2013) recorded at two different sites in the southeastern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. The candidate precursors are observed as synchronized peaks in the nonstationarity factors, introduced within the flicker-noise spectroscopy framework for signal processing, for the high-frequency component of both time series. These peaks correspond to the local reorganizations of the underlying geophysical system that are believed to precede strong earthquakes. The rodent brain activity signals are selected as potential 'immediate' (up to 2 weeks) deterministic precursors because of the recent scientific reports confirming that rodents sense imminent earthquakes and the population-genetic model of K irshvink (Soc Am 90, 312-323, ) showing how a reliable genetic seismic escape response system may have developed over the period of several hundred million years in certain animals. The use of brain activity signals, such as electroencephalograms, in contrast to conventional abnormal animal behavior observations, enables one to apply the standard 'input-sensor-response' approach to determine what input signals trigger specific seismic escape brain activity responses.

@article{Baur2008a,
abstract = {Although its use is widespread in several other scientific disciplines, the theory of tensor invariants is only marginally adopted in gravity field modeling. We aim to close this gap by developing and applying the invariants approach for geopotential recovery. Gravitational tensor invariants are deduced from products of second-order derivatives of the gravitational potential. The benefit of the method presented arises from its independence of the gradiometer instrument's orientation in space. Thus, we refrain from the classical methods for satellite gravity gradiometry analysis, i.e., in terms of individual gravity gradients, in favor of the alternative invariants approach. The invariants approach requires a tailored processing strategy. Firstly, the non-linear functionals with regard to the potential series expansion in spherical harmonics necessitates the linearization and iterative solution of the resulting least-squares problem. From the computational point of view, efficient linearization by means of perturbation theory has been adopted. It only requires the computation of reference gravity gradients. Secondly, the deduced pseudo-observations are composed of all the gravitational tensor elements, all of which require a comparable level of accuracy. Additionally, implementation of the invariants method for large data sets is a challenging task. We show the fundamentals of tensor invariants theory adapted to satellite gradiometry. With regard to the GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) satellite gradiometry mission, we demonstrate that the iterative parameter estimation process converges within only two iterations. Additionally, for the GOCE configuration, we show the invariants approach to be insensitive to the synthesis of unobserved gravity gradients.},

abstract = {Coseismic gravity changes stem from (1) vertical deformation of layer boundaries with density contrast (i.e., surface and Moho) and (2) density changes of rocks at depth. They have been observed in earthquakes with M<inf>w</inf> exceeding ∼8.5 by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, but those of M8 class earthquakes have never been detected clearly. Here we report coseismic gravity change of the 24 May 2013 Okhotsk deep earthquake (M<inf>w</inf>8.3), smaller than the detection threshold. In shallow thrust faulting, factor (2) is dominant, while factor (1) remains secondary due to poor spatial resolution of GRACE. In the 2013 Okhotsk earthquake, however, factor (2) is insignificant because they occur at depth exceeding 600km. On the other hand, factor (1) becomes dominant because the centers of uplift and subsidence are well separated and GRACE can resolve them. This enables GRACE to map vertical ground movements of deep earthquakes over both land and ocean.

This release reduces the noise in high degree and order SC, but they still need to be filtered. One of the most common filtering processing is the combination of decorrelation and Gaussian filters. Both of them are parameters dependent and must be tuned by the users. Previous studies have analyzed the parameters choice for the RL05 GRACE data for oceanic applications, and for RL04 data for global application. This study updates the latter for RL05 data extending the statistics analysis. The choice of the parameters of the decorrelation filter has been optimized to: (1) balance the noise reduction and the geophysical signal attenuation produced by the filtering process; (2) minimize the differences between GRACE and model-based data and (3) maximize the ratio of variability between continents and oceans. The Gaussian filter has been optimized following the latter criteria. Besides, an anisotropic filter, the fan filter, has been analyzed as an alternative to the Gauss filter, producing better statistics.},

@article{Floberghagen1996,
abstract = {A feasibility study is presented of high resolution and accuracy determination of the global gravity field of the Moon from a combination of low-low satellite-to-satellite range-rate observations and conventional tracking from stations on Earth. The European Moon ORbiting Observatory (MORO) mission, studied as a candidate for the third medium-sized science mission (M3) under the European Space Agency's Horizon 2000 scientific programme, is adopted for the simulation purposes. Global coverage and mapping of the fine details of the gravity field is achieved by satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST) of a small sub-satellite deployed by MORO in its 100 km polar orbit, whereas the long-wavelength features are obtained from Earth-based tracking. The combination of SST and Earth-based tracking therefore represents a powerful tool over a wide range of wavelengths. Moreover, tracking from Earth provides a clear reference for the satellite orbits, which are hard to determine from SST data only. The baseline mission proposal foresees a co-orbiting satellite pair, in which the two satellites follow each other in essentially the same orbital plane with only a small spacing in time. The MORO gravimetry experiment requirements prescribe a surface level radial acceleration accuracy of a few mGal with a surface resolution of 50-100 km. A number of satellite tracking configurations has been investigated and the influence of noise and systematic errors has been studied. Using perfect measurements and in the absence of systematic model errors, the gravity field of the Moon, assumed to be perfectly represented by the 60 ?? 60 Lun60d model of Konopliv et al. (1993) with a surface resolution of 91 km, has been recovered with a radial acceleration accuracy better than 0.003 mGal using a 3?? in-plane satellite spacing. Introducing uncorrelated random noise to the tracking links and a 10% model error in the direct solar radiation pressure model, still an accuracy better than 5 mGal can be achieved. Finally, it is shown that a small angular separation in right ascension of the ascending node of the orbital planes of MORO and its sub-satellite adds extra cross-track information to the SST range-rate signal and thus enables better determination of high sectorial and near-sectorial terms of the gravity field.

Monthly anomalies of total water storage derived from GRACE gravity fields are compared with combined soil moisture and groundwater measurements from a network of observing sites in Illinois. This comparison is achieved through the use of a recently developed filtering technique designed to selectively remove correlated errors in the GRACE spectral coefficients. Application of this filter significantly improves the spatial resolution of the GRACE water storage estimates, and produces a time series which agrees quite well (RMS difference = 20.3 mm) with the in situ measurements averaged over an area of $\sim$280,000 km2.},

abstract = {Improving the gravity field recovery in terms of error levels and more isotropic noise distribution by adding cross-track and radial information to the satellite observables has been investigated through a number of studies by a variety of satellite constellations, i.e. satellite pairs that orbit the Earth in alternative configurations than the current GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) gravity mission. This contribution gives for the first time a comparative study considering the recovery of the global gravity field from three constellations flying in satellite pairs in different directions (i.e. along-track, cross-track and radial). The three constellations include: 1) Foursatellite Bender configuration (flying in two pairs) of type along-track observations, 2) Three-satellite GRAPEN (combined GRACE with Pendulum formations) configuration of type cross-alongtrack observations, 3) Four-satellite Cartwheel configuration (flying in two pairs) of type radialalong-track observations. Additionally, a GRACE mission scenario is added as a reference “comparative” mission. The orbits of all satellites are considered to fly with drag-free system, however, realistic white noise has been added to the simulated observations to mimic the error associated with the drag-free measurement. The results are analyzed in the spectral wavelength spectrum of the gravity field up to a spherical harmonics degree of n = 100 and are plotted spatially on earth maps. The results show that the Three-satellite GRAPEN constellation provides, besides its low economically launches, an improved gravity field solution with respect to the Four-satellite Bender and the Four-satellite Cartwheel constellations.},

EOT11a benefits from FES2004, a hydrodynamic model widely used for altimetry and long time taken as reference model in GRACE gravity field modeling. In shallow water areas the M 2 and S 2 constituents show numerous extended patterns with residual amplitudes of up to 15 cm. Other major constituents and the non-linear shallow water tide M 4 hit residual amplitudes up to 5 cm. Validation at altimeter crossovers and with independent bottom pressure data confirm the significance of these findings. A correlation analysis proves the separability of the analyzed constituents.},

abstract = {It is widely known that producing a single stage to orbit spacecraft is no easy task. It is also understood that it will be the first steady step towards spacecraft that operate in much the same way as today's airliners. This, in turn is believed to decrease the economical cost of reaching space through more efficient use of a single vehicle and higher launch rates. Space is then open to the common man, either through tourism or as a transportation medium. This paper is yet another study on the physical requirements of a SSTO spacecraft. It will begin with simple assumptions and gradually build up accuracy until reaching the use of a numerical simulation tool, so as to provide the necessary insight into it. The curvature of the Earth, its gravitational field, the exhaust pressure loss and atmospheric drag are a few of the considerations that the simulation takes into account. No attention was give to the actual details of the spacecraft such as propulsion type(s), winged or lifting body (aerodynamics), active or passive cooling (thermodynamics), stability and control. All these subsystems are considered to be included into the construction mass. The drag model is a simple textbook approximation and the propulsion force is given by a hypothetical propellant and engine so as to produce the assumed range of specific impulse. Even the construction mass is supposed to be futuristic so as to reach the lowest specified values. Not only vertical take-off will be simulated but also horizontal launching from altitude (from a towing aircraft, for example). The result of the paper shows the relationship between the construction mass and the specific impulse of a given spacecraft if it is to reach low earth orbit. This paper thus aims at bringing some light to the controversial discussion of how to make these vehicles a reality. The simulation program (Matlab) is available to students.},

abstract = {This study examines present-day changes of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) by means of different data sets. We make use of monthly gravity field solutions acquired by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to study mass changes of the AIS for a 10-year period. In addition to {\textquoteleft}standard{\textquoteright} solutions of release 05, solutions based on radial base functions were used. Both solutions reveal an increased mass loss in recent years. For a 6-year period surface-height changes were inferred from laser altimetry data provided by the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). The basin-scale volume trends were converted into mass changes and were compared with the GRACE estimates for the same period. Focussing on the Thwaites Glacier, Landsat optical imagery was utilised to determine ice-flow velocities for a period of more than two decades. This data set was extended by means of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the TerraSAR-X mission, revealing an accelerated ice flow of all parts of the glacier. ICESat data over the Thwaites Glacier were complemented by digital elevation models inferred from TanDEM-X data. This extended data set exhibits an increased surface lowering in recent times. Passive microwave remote sensing data prove the long-term stability of the accumulation rates in a low accumulation zone in East Antarctica over several decades. Finally, we discuss the main error sources of present-day mass-balance estimates: the glacial isostatic adjustment effect for GRACE as well as the biases between laser operational periods and the volume--mass conversion for ICESat.},

@article{Chen2016e,
abstract = {The difficulty to detect and repair cycle slip of carrier phase measurements is a key limit for continuously high accuracy of GNSS positioning and navigation services. We propose an automated cycle slip detection and repair method for data preprocessing of a CORS network. The method jointly uses double-differenced (DD) geometry-free (GF) combination and ionospheric-free observation corrected for the computed geometrical distance (IF-OMC) to estimate the cycle slips in dual-frequency observations. The DD GF combination, which is only affected by the ionospheric residual, can be used to detect cycle slips with high reliability except for special pairs such as (77, 60) on GPS L1/L2 frequencies. The detection principle of the IF-OMC observable is such that there is a large discontinuity related to the previous epoch when cycle slips occur at the present epoch. The disadvantages of these two combinations can be overcome employing the proposed detection method. The cycle slip pair (77, 60) has no effect on the GF combination, while a change of 14.65 m is derived from GPS L1/L2 observations using the IF-OMC algorithm. Using pre-determined station coordinates as precise values, we found that the accuracy of the DD IF-OMC combination was 18 mm for a 200-km CORS baseline. Therefore, cycle slips in dual-frequency observations can be correctly and uniquely determined using DD GF and IF-OMC equations. The proposed method was verified by adding simulated cycle slips in observations collected from the CORS network under a quiet ionosphere and shown to be effective. Moreover, the method was assessed with observations made during intense ionospheric activity, which generated extensive cycle slips. The results show that the algorithm can detect and repair all cycle slips apart from two exceptions relating to long data gaps.},

@phdthesis{Daras2016a,
abstract = {This study focuses on important aspects concerning gravity field processing of future Low-LowSatellite- to-Satellite Tracking (LL-SST) satellite missions. Closed-loop simulations taking into account error models of new generation instrument technology are used to estimate the gravity field accuracy that future missions could provide. Limiting factors are identified, and methods for their treatment are de- veloped. The contribution of all error sources to the error budget is analyzed. It is shown that gravity field processing with double precision may be a limiting factor for exploiting the nm-level accuracy of a laser interferometer. An enhanced numerical precision processing scheme is proposed instead, where double and quadruple precision is used in different parts of the processing chain. It is demonstrated that processing with enhanced precision can efficiently handle laser measurements and take full advantage of their accuracy, while keeping the computational times within reasonable levels. However, error sources of considerably larger impact are expected to affect future missions, with the accelerometer instrument noise and temporal aliasing effects being the most significant ones. The effect of time-correlated noise such as the one present in accelerometer measurements, can be efficiently handled by frequency de- pendent data weighting. Residual time series that contain the effect of system errors and propagated accelerometer and laser noise, is considered as a noise realization with stationary stochastic properties. The weight matrix is constructed from the auto-correlation functions of these residuals. Applying the weight matrix to a noise case considering all error sources leads to reduction of the error level over the complete spectral bandwidth. Co-estimation of empirical accelerations does not showthe same efficiency in reducing the propagated noise with the applied processing strategy. Temporal aliasing effects are re- duced essentially by adding a second pair of satellites at an inclined orbit. Compared to a GRACE-type near-polar pair, such a Bender-type constellation delivers solutions with major improvements in terms of de-aliasing potential and recovery performance. When the integrated effect of all geophysical processes is recovered, the maximum spatial resolution of 11-day solutions can be increased from 715 to 315 km half-wavelength. A further reduction of temporal aliasing errors is possible by co-parameterizing low resolution gravity fields at short time intervals, together with the higher resolution gravity field which is sampled at a longer time interval. One day was found to be the optimal sampling period for reducing the error levels in the solutions. A uniform sampling at the co-parameterized short periods, is a prereq- uisite for an efficient reduction of aliasing errors. High frequency atmospheric signals are captured by daily solutions to a large extent. Hence co-parameterization at daily basis results in significant reduction of aliasing caused by their under-sampling. This enables future gravity satellite missions to deliver the complete spectrum of Earth's geophysical processes. The corresponding by-products of daily gravity field solutions are expected to be very useful to atmospheric science and open doors to new fields of application.},

@article{Harl2013,
abstract = {A novel technique for estimating uncertainties caused by gravitational perturbations is presented. The approach, called the Modified State Observer (MSO), allows for the estimation of uncertainties in nonlinear dynamics while in addition providing estimates of the system states. The observer structure contains neural networks whose outputs are the uncertainties in the system. A useful and important application of this observer is the problem of determining uncertainties with an inaccurate gravity mode that a satellite may experience when orbiting a body. With future space missions involving other bodies such as asteroids that produce gravitational perturbations which are highly uncertain and are subjected to unknown physical influences, the MSO can be used not only to estimate the states of the satellites, it can be used to estimate the uncertainties that could further be analyzed further in understanding the physical phenomena. To demonstrate the utility of the MSO for this class of problem, the technique is applied for three cases: estimating the uncertainty caused by the J2 perturbation for Earth and Mars orbiters, and estimating the uncertainty in an asteroid's gravitational field. Simulations are presented which indicate that the observer can accurately estimate both the periodic nature of these perturbations as well as the magnitudes. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

abstract = {The International GNSS Service (IGS) is an international activity involving more than 200 participating organisations in over 80 countries with a track record of one and a half decades of successful operations. The IGS is a service of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG). It primarily supports scientific research based on highly precise and accurate Earth observations using the technologies of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), primarily the US Global Positioning System (GPS). The mission of the IGS is “to provide the highest-quality GNSS data and products in support of the terrestrial reference frame, Earth rotation, Earth observation and research, positioning, navigation and timing and other applications that benefit society”. The IGS will continue to support the IAG's initiative to coordinate cross-technique global geodesy for the next decade, via the development of the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS), which focuses on the needs of global geodesy at the mm-level. IGS activities are fundamental to scientific disciplines related to climate, weather, sea level change, and space weather. The IGS also supports many other applications, including precise navigation, machine automation, and surveying and mapping. This article discusses the IGS Strategic Plan and future directions of the globally-coordinated ̃400 station IGS network, tracking data and information products, and outlines the scope of a few of its numerous working groups and pilot projects as the world anticipates a truly multi-system GNSS in the coming decade.},

abstract = {We propose a new estimate of the mass balance of the West/East Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets from GRACE for the recent period (July 2002-March 2005) and compute the corresponding contribution to the global mean sea level. We use new GRACE geoid solutions provided by the Groupe de Recherche en G{\'{e}}od{\'{e}}sie Spatiale (GRGS/CNES), at the resolution of ∼ 400 km and sampled at 10-day interval. In the three regions, significant interannual variations are observed, which we approximate as linear trends over the short time span of analysis. Over Greenland, an apparent total volume loss of 119 +/- 10 cu km/yr water is observed. For the Antarctica ice sheet, a bimodal behaviour is apparent, with volume loss amounting to 88 +/- 10 cu km/yr water in the West, and increase in the East amounting to 72 +/- 20 cu km/yr water. These GRACE results are affected by land hydrology contamination and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) of the solid Earth since last deglaciation. We correct for both land hydrology contamination (using a global hydrological model) and GIA using the ICE-4G model for Greenland and the IJ05 model for Antarctica. Corrected for both land hydrology contamination and GIA, GRACE volume rates are - 129 +/- 15 cu km/yr, - 107 +/- 23 cu km/yr and + 67 +/- 28 cu km/yr for Greenland, West Antarctica and East Antarctica respectively. In terms of sea level rise, the GRACE-based ice sheets contributions are + 0.36 +/- 0.04 mm/yr for Greenland, + 0.30 +/- 0.06 mm/yr for West Antarctica and - 0.19 +/- 0.07 for East Antarctica for the time interval of study. The total Antarctica contribution to sea level over this short time span is thus slightly positive (+ 0.11 +/- 0.09 mm/yr). The ice sheets together contribute to a sea level rise of 0.47 +/- 0.1 mm/yr. The results reported here are in qualitative agreement with recent estimates of the mass balance of the ice sheets based on GRACE and with those based upon other remote sensing observations. Due to the very short sampling time span for which the GRACE data are available, it is not yet possible to distinguish between interannual oscillations and long-term trend associated with climate change. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Other features of STL are specification of amounts of seasonal and trend smoothing that range, in a nearly continuous way, from a very small amount of smoothing to a very large amount; robust estimates of the trend and seasonal components that are not distorted by aberrant behavior in the data; specification of the period of the seasonal component to any integer multiple of the time sampling interval greater than one; and the ability to decompose time series with missing values.},

abstract = {The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) is the European Space Agency's (ESA)satellite gravity mission to determine the Earth's mean gravity field. GOCE delivers gravity gradients, anew type of satellite data. We study how these data can improve modeling of the Earth's lithosphere. We discuss the use of the original GOCE gravity gradients versus the use of gravity gradients in grids at satellite altitude or close the Earth's surface and conclude that grids are easier to handle than the original data because one does not have to deal with very different error characteristics of the different gradients, given in a rotating frame at varying heights. The downward continuation to the surface enhances signaland better reflects the near-surface geology. But this does not outweigh the amplification of noise and omission errors, which is why we recommend using the field at mean satellite altitude for lithospheric modeling. The North-East Atlantic region is ideal to analyze the additional value of GOCE gravity gradients because it is a well-studied region in terms of regional geophysics. We calculated the gradient sensitivity for crustal depth slices using a 3D lithospheric model. This reveals that especially interfaces with large density contrasts have a distinct signal in the gravity gradients, but that they are quite insensitive to intra-crustal density sources, which can have quite a large effect on surface gravity data. We also show thatthe satellite gradients have a depth sensitivity well suited to study the upper mantle density structure, making them complementary to gravity and seismic tomography. In the underexplored Rub'al-Khaliarea the GOCE vertical gradient was used to invert for crustal thickness. The updated Moho model givesa good fit to four of the six gradients and independent depths from seismic stations. The Moho modelwas used to update the heat flow model and source rock maturity maps, which are generally consistent with known source rock maturity trends in the surrounding regions. GOCE gradients are therefore usefulto map crustal thickness and deep regional structures for frontier areas. In combination with other data, heat flow can be modeled which is essential for basin maturity evaluation.},

abstract = {One of the major problems one has to deal with when working with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data is the increasing error spectrum at higher degrees in the provided Stokes coefficients, appearing as unphysical North-South striping patterns in the maps of equivalent water height (EWH). This phenomenon is commonly suppressed by application of a Gaussian smoothing filter, which unfortunately causes loss of signal and leakage between basins. In this paper we show how a significant amount of the striping can be removed by making use of the temporal characteristics of the error spectrum. The Stokes coefficients are decomposed using empirical orthogonal function analysis and the individual modes are tested for temporal noisiness. After filtering, maps of EWH are largely free of striping. Tests on simulated EWH estimates show that our filtering technique has a marginal effect on the predicted geophysical signal.

abstract = {Laser-cooling of atoms and atom-trapping are finding increasing application in many areas of science1 . One important use of laser- cooled atoms is in atom interferometers2 . In these devices, an atom is placed into a superposition of two or more spatially separated atomic states; these states are each described by a quantum-mechanical phase term, which will interfere with one another if they are brought back together at a later time. Atom interferometers have been shown to be very precise inertial sensors for acceleration3,4 , rotation5 and for the measurement of the fine structure constant6 . Here we use an atom interferometer based on a fountain of laser-cooled atoms to measure g, the acceleration of gravity. Through detailed investigation and elimination of systematic effects that may affect the accuracy of the measurement, we achieve an absolute uncertainty of ?g=g ?3?10?9 , representing a million-fold increase in absolute accuracy compared with previous atom-interferometer experiments7 .We also compare our measurement with the value of g obtained at the same laboratory site using a Michelson interferometer gravimeter (a modern equivalent of Galileo's ‘leaning tower' experiment in Pisa). We show that the macro- scopic glass object used in this instrument falls with the same acceleration, to within 7 parts in 109, as a quantum-mechanical caesium atom.},

abstract = {Estimation of correlation with appropriate uncertainty limits for scientific data that are potentially serially correlated is a common problem made seriously challenging especially when data are sampled unevenly in space and/or time. Here we present a new, robust method for estimating correlation with uncertainty limits between autocorrelated series that does not require either resampling or interpolation. The technique employs the Gaussian kernel method with a bootstrapping resampling approach to derive the probability density function and resulting uncertainties. The method is validated using an example from radar geophysics. Autocorrelation and error bounds are estimated for an airborne radio-echo profile of ice sheet thickness. The computed limits are robust when withholding 10%, 20%, and 50% of data. As a further example, the method is applied to two time-series of methanesulphonic acid in Antarctic ice cores from different sites. We show how the method allows evaluation of the significance of correlation where the signal-to-noise ratio is low and reveals that the two ice cores exhibit a significant common signal.},

abstract = {By combining satellite Gradiometry with SST-high-low GPS tracking, the ESA GOCE mission aims to provide a high resolution Gravity Field to the Scientific and Engineering communities. Continuous 3D GPS tracking of the satellite and compensation of non-gravitational forces, thanks to on–board accelerometers, opens the way to the measurement of the difference in gravitational acceleration at the accelerometers position. The short baseline of the instrument (50 cm) allows us to interpret this value as the second derivative of the gravitational potential; the effect of double derivation balances the altitude attenuation of the potential to permit observation of the gravity field with an unprecedented accuracy of 1-2 mgal and resolution of 100 km at the highest order. The Gradiometer is the 3D instrument which makes this measurement possible along the in-track and cross-tracks directions, is made of: •3 accelerometer pairs (sensors and electronic units) •Ultra stable Carbon-carbon structure to support the accelerometer •Accurate passive and active thermal control The paper will describe the 6 accelerometers provided by ONERA together with the test plan developed to guarantee a level of noise acceleration as low as 2.0 10-12 ms-2 Hz-1/2 as required by the mission scientific performance. The accelerometers are based on a principle similar to the ones embarked on GRACE Tom & Jerry satellites but with some technological evolution to improve their resolution by 2 orders of magnitude. Their contribution to the mission is double by providing the S/C with the linear accelerations as input to the continuous Drag-Free system and with the measured scientific to be on-ground processed. Results of the dedicated on-ground test including Free fall test will be presented for the 6 accelerometers. The launch date of the GOCE mission is 2008, May 31st. The accelerometers of the GOCE mission have been developed by ONERA under contract with ThalesAleniaSpace France as Prime Contractor of the Gradiometer.},

abstract = {A useful ionospheric delay model to compensate for the effect of ionospheric error on GNSS service over continent-wide areas or oceans is the Satellite-Based Augmentation System's wide-area thin-shell planar fit ionospheric grid model. In order to implement a proper wide-area ionospheric delay model in the Asia-Pacific region to reflect the variation introduced by local ionospheric activity, the present study develops a proper ionospheric delay model to correct ionospheric error in middle- and low-magnetic-latitude regions. Specifically, the proposed ionospheric delay model uses several dual-frequency GNSS reference stations distributed in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and China as grid points in place of the conventional grid points generated by ionospheric pierce points. The ionospheric delays observed at the reference stations are processed and provided to the user, who can then construct the ionospheric delay model using weighted least squares with the distances between the user and the stations as weights. This proposed ionospheric delay model lowers the computation load by eliminating the conversion of delays at the ionospheric pierce points to those at the grid points and provides good descriptions of dynamic variations due to the ionospheric activities. Also, a simplified model is developed to further reduce its computation load while providing almost the same service as that of the original proposed model. A selection mechanism between the original proposed model and its simplified version is developed as well. The details of the proposed ionospheric delay model are explained, and experiments conducted using data collected from the reference stations in the Asia-Pacific region are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by comparison with the conventional wide-area thin-shell planar fit ionospheric grid model provided by the Japanese Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System under both nominal and disturbed ionospheric conditions.},

abstract = {Evaluating global mean sea level (GMSL) in terms of its components---mass and steric---is useful for both quantifying the accuracy of the measurements and understanding the processes that contribute to GMSL rise. In this paper, we review the GMSL budget over two periods---1993 to 2014 and 2005 to 2014---using multiple data sets of both total GMSL and the components (mass and steric). In addition to comparing linear trends, we also compare the level of agreement of the time series. For the longer period (1993--2014), we find closure in terms of the long-term trend but not for year-to-year variations, consistent with other studies. This is due to the lack of sufficient estimates of the amount of natural water mass cycling between the oceans and hydrosphere. For the more recent period (2005--2014), we find closure in both the long-term trend and for month-to-month variations. This is also consistent with previous studies.},

abstract = {A two-parameter annual water balance model was developed for reconstructing annual terrestrial water storage change ($\Delta$TWS) and groundwater storage change ($\Delta$GWS). The model was integrated with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and applied to the Punjab province in Pakistan for reconstructing $\Delta$TWS and $\Delta$GWS during 1980–2015 based on multiple input data sources. Model parameters were estimated through minimizing the root-mean-square error between the Budyko-modeled and GRACE-derived $\Delta$TWS during 2003–2015. The correlation of ensemble means between Budyko-modeled and GRACE-derived $\Delta$TWS is 0.68 with p-value <0.05. The $\Delta$GWS was reconstructed by subtracting soil moisture storage change from the Budyko-modeled $\Delta$TWS and was validated (i.e., r = 0.74, p-value < 0.05) against well observations during the pre-GRACE period (i.e., 1985–1994). The negative values of the cumulative sum of the reconstructed $\Delta$GWS during 1980–2015 (i.e., −13.6 ± 9.7 cm) indicate that the aquifer in Punjab has experienced depletion. The estimated depletion rate is −0.3 ± 0.2 cm/year and it has a negative correlation (i.e., r = −0.70, p-value < 0.0001) with the total number of tube wells installed in Punjab. The integration of the developed Budyko model with GRACE data provides a new way for evaluating long-term groundwater depletion in large-scale irrigation regions with parsimonious models.},

@article{Gopinath2004,
abstract = {The inclination of remote-sensing satellites, which are generally placed in sun-synchronous orbits, varies as a function of the nominal equatorial crossing local mean solar time selected for a given mission. The Indian Remote-Sensing satellites will have an inclination reduction of about 0.034° per year and for most of the satellites, the local time chosen was around 10:30 hours at descending node. In practice, the initial inclination is biased appropriately so that the expensive out-of-plane maneuvers could be taken up after few years of mission operations, depending on the deviations permitted in the local time for a given mission. However, the scenario differs when the mission objectives require an almost exact repeat orbit of 14 or 15 per day. In such a situation, the satellite orbit, which passes through a 14th or 15th order resonance, undergoes a nearly secular increase in orbit inclination. This paper presents a detailed analysis carried out for such an orbit, based on Cowell's approach. Long-term predictions have been carried out by considering all major forces that perturbs the satellite orbit. Observed behavior of orbit, based on the daily definitive orbit determination is also presented. The variation in inclination and the cause is clearly brought out. Further, it is demonstrated that the selection of longitude for nominal ground track pattern has an impact on the inclination variation. A proposal is made to take advantage of such expected inclination variation so that initial inclination bias can be chosen appropriately. Ground track longitude can be chosen to take advantage, subject to the mission coverage requirements. The paper contains the results of an exhaustive analysis of the actually observed orbit resonance. It is felt that the work has both theoretical and operational importance for remote-sensing missions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It has been postulated that Lake Naivasha, Kenya, has experienced a rapid decrease (and fluctuations) in its spatial extent and level between the years 2002 to 2010. Many factors have been advanced to explain this, with horticultural and floricultural activities, as well as climatic change, featuring prominently. This study offers a multi-disciplinary approach based on several different types of space-borne observations to look at the problem bedeviling Lake Naivasha, which is a Ramsar listed wetland of international importance. The data includes: (1) Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) time-variable gravity field products to derive total water storage (TWS) variations within a region covering the Lakes Naivasha and Victoria basins; (2) precipitation records based on Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) products to evaluate the impact of climate change; (3) satellite remote sensing (Landsat) images to map shoreline changes and to correlate these changes over time with possible causes; and (4) satellite altimetry observations to assess fluctuations in the lake's level. In addition, data from an in situ tide gauge and rainfall stations as well as the output from the African Drought Monitor (ADM) model are used to evaluate the results. This study confirms that Lake Naivasha has been steadily declining with the situation being exacerbated from around the year 2000, with water levels falling at a rate of 10.2cm/year and a shrinkage in area of 1.04km2/year. GRACE indicates that the catchment area of 4°×4° that includes Lake Naivasha loses water at a rate of 1.6cm/year for the period from August 2002 to May 2006, and 1.4cm/year for the longer period of May 2002 to 2010. Examining the ADM outputs also supports our results of GRACE. Between the time periods 2000-2006 and 2006-2010, the lake surface area decreased by 14.43% and 10.85%, respectively, with a corresponding drop in the water level of 192cm and 138cm, respectively, over the same periods. Our results show a correlation coefficient value of 0.68 between the quantity of flower production and the lake's level for the period 2002-2010 at 95% confidence level, indicating the probable impact of anthropogenic activities on the lake's level drop. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We propose a novelmethod to investigate the statistical significance of trends of extreme values in serially correlated time series based on quantile regression and surrogate data. This method has the advantage over traditional extreme value methods that it takes into account all data points from the time series. We test this method on a temperature time series from the Antarctic Peninsula (Faraday/Vernadsky station), which is highly non-Gaussian and serially corre- lated. We find evidence for a significant upward nonlinear trend in the extreme cold temperatures (95th percentile) and that most of the observed warming at Faraday/Vernadsky is due to a reduction in cold extremes. Quantile regres- sion can also be used for multivariate regression with external factors. This multivariate regression analysis sug- gests that CO2 emissions play a large role in the observed trend at Faraday/Vernadsky while also the ozone hole and solar fluctuations play some role.},

abstract = {Satellite drag coefficients are a major source of uncertainty in predicting the drag force on satellites in low Earth orbit. Among other things, accurately predicting the orbit requires detailed knowledge of the satellite drag coefficient. Computational methods are an important tool in computing the drag coefficient but are too intensive for real-time and predictive applications. Therefore, analytic or empirical models that can accurately predict drag coefficients are desired. This work uses response surfaces to model drag coefficients. The response surface methodology is validated by developing a response surface model for the drag coefficient of a sphere where the closed-form solution is known. The response surface model performs well in predicting the drag coefficient of a sphere with a root mean square percentage error less than 0.3% over the entire parameter space. For more complex geometries, such as the GRACE satellite, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the International Space Station, the model errors are only slightly larger at about 0.9%, 0.6%, and 1.0%, respectively.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The manner in which errors in tide models affect monthly gravity solutions from GRACE satellite data is re-examined. We perform a complete simulation of GRACE gravity estimation, including allowance for accelerometer calibrations and satellite state-vector adjustment. Errors in monthly geoid estimates are for most regions of a order of 0.5 mm, or roughly 1 cm of equivalent water height when smoothed over radii of 600 km. In polar regions where ocean tide models are suspect, errors can grow significantly larger: over 2 mm in geoid height, although over very localized regions. Errors from diurnal tides tend to cancel, but they are not completely eliminated, inducing geoid errors of the order of 0.3 mm. The currently accepted GRACE total error budget is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the component arising from tide modelling errors.},

@article{Kjær2015,
abstract = {Over the past quarter of a century the Arctic has warmed more than any other region on Earth, causing a profound impact on the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its contribution to the rise in global sea level. The loss of ice can be partitioned into processes related to surface mass balance and to ice discharge, which are forced by internal or external (atmospheric/oceanic/basal) fluctuations. Regardless of the measurement method, observations over the last two decades show an increase in ice loss rate, associated with speeding up of glaciers and enhanced melting. However, both ice discharge and melt-induced mass losses exhibit rapid short-term fluctuations that, when extrapolated into the future, could yield erroneous long-term trends. In this paper we review the GrIS mass loss over more than a century by combining satellite altimetry, airborne altimetry, interferometry, aerial photographs and gravimetry data sets together with modelling studies. We revisit the mass loss of different sectors and show that they manifest quite different sensitivities to atmospheric and oceanic forcing. In addition, we discuss recent progress in constructing coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere models required to project realistic future sea-level changes.},

abstract = {The primary objectives of this research were to investigate the potential of precipitable water vapour (PWV) estimates derived from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) measurements, firstly, for short-term weather forecasting based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) in Luxembourg and its surroundings and, secondly, for monitoring climate on regional and global scales. The suitability of real-time (RT) zenith total delay (ZTD) estimates obtained from three different precise point positioning (PPP) software packages was assessed by comparing them with the state-of-the-art product from the International GNSS Service (namely the IGS Final troposphere product) as well as collocated radiosonde (RS) observations. It was found that the RT-PPP ZTD estimates from two of the three software packages meet the threshold requirements for NWP nowcasting. The biases between the RT-PPP ZTD and the reference ZTD were found to be stable over time for all the RT-PPP ZTD solutions. A millimetre-level impact on the RT-PPP ZTD estimates was also observed when integer ambiguities were resolved. The impact of assimilating GNSS-derived near real-time (NRT) ZTD in the Applications of Research to Operations at Mesoscale (AROME) NWP model using a three-dimensional, variational (3D-VAR) assimilation scheme on the quality of weather forecasts for Luxembourg was studied. It was found that the assimilation of GNSS-derived ZTD systematically improves the atmospheric humidity short-range forecasts in comparison to other water vapour observing systems (radio soundings, satellite radiances, surface networks). Examination of several case studies revealed the ability of the ZTD observations to modify the intensity and location of predicted precipitation in accordance with previous studies. The addition of ZTD from the dense GNSS network in Wallonie (Belgium) was also found to be beneficial by improving the prediction of rainfall patterns in Luxembourg. The 2D maps of IWV obtained from the hourly NRT system were compared with cloud distribution and precipitation maps from satellite and weather radar data, respectively, and a good agreement in the location of the front system was found. A rise in IWV was recorded during a precipitation event in Luxembourg and it was shown that by observing the IWV change over the ground-based GNSS stations in Luxembourg in NRT, it is possible to determine the speed and direction of the passing fronts and hence storms can also be tracked. A 5-year long global reprocessed GNSS data set containing over 400 ground-based GNSS stations and based on the double differencing strategy has been used to validate the ZTD estimates obtained from the climate reanalysis model of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) namely the ECMWF ReAnalysis-Interim (ERA-Interim) in different climate zones. It was found that the correlation coefficient between the GNSS-derived ZTD observations and the ZTD modeled by ERA-Interim ranges from 0.87 to 1.00. Higher correlation coefficients were found for the stations belonging to the climate zones with lower amount of water vapour. Furthermore, it was found that the mean, SDev and RMS of the differences depends on periodicity in the residuals, altitude of the stations in a particular zone as well as the topographic variation in the zone. Monthly and seasonal means of GNSS-derived ZTD (ZTDgnss) were computed using a global ZTDgnss dataset consisting of 19-years of data and over 400 stations to study the climate variability in different climate zones. In terms of seasonal means, it was found that the climate zones in the northern hemisphere have ZTD maxima in Boreal Summer (June-July-August) whereas those in the southern hemisphere have ZTD maxima in Austral Summer (December-January-February). Monthly and seasonal variability in ZTDgnss was also studied for the locations of 6 ground-based GNSS (SPSLux) stations in Luxembourg. It was found that all the 6 SPSLux stations experience the same monthly and seasonal variability of ZTDgnss. In terms of monthly variation, it was found that the maxima in ZTDgnss occurs around the month of July for all the 6 SPSLux stations whereas in terms of seasonal variation, the location of maxima was found to be in Summer (June-July-August). The suitability of the ZTD derived using precise point positioning (PPP) strategy for climate monitoring applications was studied through its comparison with the ZTD estimates derived using double differenced positioning (DDP) using a global network of 114 stations and duration of 1 year. The mean differences between the two were found to be ranging from -3.35 to 2.37 mm over different climate zones. Furthermore, correlation coefficients ranging from 0.90 and 1.00 were found between the ZTD obtained using the two processing strategies. It was found that use of higher elevation cut-off angles and tropospheric mapping functions based on NWP improves the agreement between the PPP and DDP solutions.},

abstract = {We document two kinds of traveling ionospheric disturbances, namely, CTIDs (Co-tsunami- Traveling-Ionospheric-disturbances) and ATIDs (Ahead-of-Tsunami-Traveling-Ionosphericdisturbances) related to the Tohoku-Oki tsunami of 2011 March 11. They are referred to the disturbances that remain behind and ahead of the principal tsunami wave front, respectively. We first note their presence in a numerical experiment performed using a simulation code coupling the tsunami, atmosphere and ionosphere. This code uses the tsunami wavefield as an input and simulates acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) in the atmosphere and TIDs, in the form of total electron content (TEC) disturbance, in the ionosphere. The simulated TEC reveals the excitation of CTIDs (at about 2 TECU) and ATIDs (at about 1 TECU), representing up to 5 per cent disturbance over the ambient electron density, and they arise from the dissipation of AGWs in the thermosphere. A novel outcome is that during the tsunami passage between $\sim$6° and 12° of epicentral distance, strong ATIDs arrive $\sim$20-60 min ahead of the tsunami wave front covering $\sim$3°-10° of distance from the tsunami location. Simulation results are compared with the far-field observations using GNSS satellites and confirm that ATIDs are the first detected TEC maximum, occurring 20-60 min ahead of the tsunami arrival. Our simulation also confirms the presence of largest TEC maximum representing CTIDs, 10- 20 min after the first tsunami wave. ATIDs reported in this study have characteristics that can be potentially used for the early warning of the tsunami.},

abstract = {GEOScan is a proposed space-based facility of globally networked instruments that will provide revolutionary, massively dense global geosciences observations. Major scientific research projects are typically conducted using two approaches: community facilities, and investigator lead focused missions. While science from space is almost exclusively conducted within the mission model, GEOScan is a new concept designed as a constellation facility from space utilizing a suite of space-based sensors that optimizes the scientific value across the greatest number of scientific disciplines in the earth and geosciences, while constraining cost and accommodation related parameters. Our grassroots design processes target questions that have not, and will not be answered until simultaneous global measurements are made. The relatively small size, mass, and power of the GEOScan instruments make them an ideal candidate for a hosted payload aboard a global constellation of communication satellites, such as the Iridium NEXT's 66- satellite constellation. This paper will focus on the design and planning components of this new type of heterogeneous, multi-node facility concept, such as: costing, design for manufacture, science synergy, and operations of this non-traditional mission concept. We will demonstrate that this mission design concept has distinct advantages over traditional monolithic satellite missions for a number of scientific measurement priorities and data products due to the constellation configuration, scaled manufacturing and facility model.},

abstract = {The Swarm satellites were launched on 22 November 2013 and carry accelerometers and GPS receivers as part of their scientific payload. The GPS receivers are not only used for locating the position and time of the magnetic measurements, but also for determining non-gravitational forces like drag and radiation pressure acting on the spacecraft. The accelerometers measure these forces directly, at much finer resolution than the GPS receivers, from which thermospheric neutral densities and potentially winds can be derived. Unfortunately, the acceleration measurements suffer from a variety of disturbances, the most prominent being slow temperature-induced bias variations and sudden bias changes. These disturbances have caused a significant delay of the accelerometer data release. In this presentation, we describe the new three-stage processing that is required for transforming the disturbed acceleration measurements into scientifically valuable thermospheric neutral densities. In the first stage, the sudden bias changes in the acceleration measurements are removed using a dedicated software tool. The second stage is the calibration of the accelerometer measurements against the non-gravitational accelerations derived from the GPS receiver, which includes the correction for the slow temperature-induced bias variations. The third stage consists of transforming the corrected and calibrated accelerations into thermospheric neutral densities.

abstract = {The use of passive Laser reflectors on the lunar surface has been the most attractive in the Apollo era among alternative measurement techniques, but the laser link margin is very small, permitting only very few stations to obtain valid measurements. Therefore the next generation of the LLR (Lunar Laser Ranging) technique should aim for a substantial improvement. We propose a one-way ranging concept involving Laser transponders. A particular strength of this proposed experiment is given when several stations are ranging to the Moon simultaneously and/or when several geodetic stations on the Moon are used simultaneously, as this is expected to improve the modeling geometry and data quality. The proposed experiment may well initiate the installation of new observing stations on Earth - perhaps within the infrastructure of existing astronomical observatories. At the same time it allows many more SLR (Satellite Laser Ranging) stations from the existing network to obtain measurements from the Moon. In the case of the beacon mode, only passive optical receivers are needed on the ground. In addition, we propose to deploy and operate a microwave receiver/transmitter with precisely known mechanical local ties to the laser beacon/receiver, which will permit observations of the tangential position of the Moon with respect to the celestial frame. We also propose to include a GNSS microwave transmitter into the equipment realizing a GPS/Galileo satellite on the Moon that is tracked together with GNSS satellites by receivers on the ground and possibly on a future generation of GNSS satellites. The ultimate objectives of our proposal are threefold, the improvement of the reference frames for the Earth, a better understanding of the Moons interior, and a better determination of the parameters of General Relativity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Gravity field determination using the measurements of Global Positioning receivers onboard low Earth orbiters and inter-satellite measurements in a constellation of satellites is a generalized orbit determination problem involving all satellites of the constellation. The celestial mechanics approach (CMA) is comprehensive in the sense that it encompasses many different methods currently in use, in particular so-called short-arc methods, reduced-dynamic methods, and pure dynamic methods. The method is very flexible because the actual solution type may be selected just prior to the combination of the satellite-, arc- and technique-specific normal equation systems. It is thus possible to generate ensembles of substantially different solutions—essentially at the cost of generating one particular solution. The article outlines the general aspects of orbit and gravity field determination. Then the focus is put on the particularities of the CMA, in particular on the way to use accelerometer data and the statistical information associated with it.},

@article{Slangen2017,
abstract = {Sea-level change (SLC) is a much-studied topic in the area of climate research, integrating a range of climate science disciplines, and is expected to impact coastal communities around the world. As a result, this field is rapidly moving, and the knowledge and understanding of processes contributing to SLC is increasing. Here, we discuss noteworthy recent developments in the projection of SLC contributions and in the global mean and regional sea-level projections. For the Greenland Ice Sheet contribution to SLC, earlier estimates have been confirmed in recent research, but part of the source of this contribution has shifted from dynamics to surface melting. New insights into dynamic discharge processes and the onset of marine ice sheet instability increase the projected range for the Antarctic contribution by the end of the century. The contribution from both ice sheets is projected to increase further in the coming centuries to millennia. Recent updates of the global glacier outline database and new global glacier models have led to slightly lower projections for the glacier contribution to SLC (7–17 cm by 2100), but still project the glaciers to be an important contribution. For global mean sea-level projections, the focus has shifted to better estimating the uncertainty distributions of the projection time series, which may not necessarily follow a normal distribution. Instead, recent studies use skewed distributions with longer tails to higher uncertainties. Regional projections have been used to study regional uncertainty distributions, and regional projections are increasingly being applied to specific regions, countries, and coastal areas.},

@article{Huang2015,
abstract = {Quantifying the human effects on water resources plays an important role in river basin management. In this study, we proposed a framework, which integrates the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite estimation with macroscale hydrological model simulation, for detection and attribution of spatial terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes. In particular, it provides valuable insights for regions where ground-based measurements are inaccessible. Moreover, this framework takes into account the feedback between land and atmosphere and innovatively put forward several suggestions (e.g., study period selection, hydrological model selection based on soil moisture-climate interactions) to minimize the uncertainties brought by the interaction of human water use with terrestrial water fluxes. We demonstrate the use of the proposed framework in the Yangtze River basin of China. Our results show that, during the period 2003–2010, the TWS was continually increasing in the middle and south eastern reaches of the basin, at a mean rate of about 3 cm yr−1. This increment in TWS was attributed to anthropogenic modification of the hydrological cycle, rather than natural climate variability. The dominant contributor to the TWS excess was found to be intensive surface water irrigation, which recharged the water table in the middle and south eastern parts of the basin. Water impoundment in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is found to account for nearly 20% of the human-induced TWS increment in the region where the TGR is located. The proposed framework gives water managers/researchers a useful tool to investigate the spatial human effects on TWS changes.},

In this study, the SGG data in the local north-oriented and orbital frames are inverted to the gravity anomaly at sea level using the second-order partial derivatives of the extended Stokes formula. The emphasis is on the spatial truncation error and the kernel behaviour of the integral formulas in the aforementioned frames. The paper will show that only the diagonal elements of gravitational tensor at satellite level are suitable for recovering the gravity anomaly at sea level.

abstract = {It is formally proved that the general smoother for nonlinear dynamics can be formulated as a sequential method, that is, observations can be assimilated sequentially during a. forward integration. The general filter san be derived from the smoother and it is shown that the general smoother end filter solutions at the final time become identical, as is expected from linear theory. Then, a new smoother algorithm based on ensemble statistics is presented and examined in an example with the Lorenz equations. The new smoother can be computed as a sequential algorithm using only forward-in-time model integrations. It bears a strong resemblance with the ensemble Kalman filter. The difference is that every time a new dataset is available during the forward integration, an analysis is computed for all previous times up to this time. Thus, the first guess for the smoother is the ensemble Kalman filter solution, and the smoother estimate provides an improvement of this, as one would expect a smoother to do. The method is demonstrated in this paper in an intercomparison with the ensemble Kalman filter and the ensemble smoother introduced by van Lecuwen and Evensen, and it is shown to be superior in an application with the Lorenz equations. Finally, a discussion is given regarding the properties of the analysis schemes when strongly non-Gaussian distributions are used. It is shown that in these cases more sophisticated analysis schemes based on Bayesian statistics must be used.},

abstract = {We propose a "constrained" least-squares approach to estimate regional maps of equivalent-water heights by inverting GRACE-based potential anomalies at satellite altitude. According to the energy integral method, the anomalies of difference of geopotential between the two GRACE vehicles are derived from along-track K-Band Range-Rate (KBRR) residuals that correspond mainly to the continental water storage changes, once a priori known accelerations (i.e. static field, polar movements, atmosphere and ocean masses including tides) are removed during the orbit adjustment process. Newton's first law merely enables the Difference of Potential Anomalies from accurate KBRR data and the equivalent-water heights to be recovered. Spatial constraints versus spherical distance between elementary surface tiles are introduced to stabilize the linear system to cancel the effects of the north-south striping. Unlike the "mascons" approach, no basis of orthogonal functions (e.g., spherical harmonics) is used, so that the proposed regional method does not suffer from drawbacks related to any spectrum truncation. Time series of 10-day regional maps over South America for 2006-2009 also prove to be consistent with independent data sets, namely the outputs of hydrological models, "mascons" and global GRACE solutions.},

abstract = {Enhanced measurement of the variation of the terrestrial water cycle are imperative to better understand the dynamics, water availability, and evaluate impacts of global changes on the water cycle. This study quantified storage in the various terrestrial water compartments using an integrated hydrologic model (IHM) - MIKE SHE that simulates the entire terrestrial water cycle and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data in the intensively irrigated Northern High Plains (area $\sim$ 250,000 km2). The IHM, mainly constructed using in-situ data, was evaluated using field measured groundwater level, stream flow, and soil moisture data. The model was first used to calculate the incremental water storage for each water balance component (e.g. storage in the saturated zone) and then the GRACE equivalent terrestrial water storage anomaly. In the study area, storage in the saturated zone is the major component of the terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomaly. The GRACE-derived TWS anomaly and the anomaly simulated from the model are generally in agreement on a monthly scale with few discrepancies. Generally, both GRACE and the IHM results displayed a statistically significant increasing trend in the total TWS and groundwater storage anomalies from 2002-2013 over the Northern High Plains. This study demonstrates the applicability of an integrated hydrologic model to monitor TWS variations in a large area, and GRACE data and IHMs are capable of reproducing observed trends in TWS.},

abstract = {Earth's spin axis has been wandering along the Greenwich meridian since about 2000, representing a 75{\textdegree} eastward shift from its long-term drift direction. The past 115 years have seen unequivocal evidence for a quasi-decadal periodicity, and these motions persist throughout the recent record of pole position, in spite of the new drift direction. We analyze space geodetic and satellite gravimetric data for the period 2003–2015 to show that all of the main features of polar motion are explained by global-scale continent-ocean mass transport. The changes in terrestrial water storage {(TWS)} and global cryosphere together explain nearly the entire amplitude (83 {\textpm} 23%) and mean directional shift (within 5.9{\textdegree} {\textpm} 7.6{\textdegree}) of the observed motion. We also find that the {TWS} variability fully explains the decadal-like changes in polar motion observed during the study period, thus offering a clue to resolving the long-standing quest for determining the origins of decadal oscillations. This newly discovered link between polar motion and global-scale {TWS} variability has broad implications for the study of past and future climate.},

abstract = {Twelve GPS Block IIF satellites, out of the current constellation, can transmit on three-frequency signals (L1, L2, L5). Taking advantages of these signals, Three-Carrier Ambiguity Resolution (TCAR) is expected to bring much benefit for ambiguity resolution. One of the research areas is to find the optimal combined signals for a better ambiguity resolution in geometry-free (GF) and geometry-based (GB) mode. However, the existing researches select the signals through either pure theoretical analysis or testing with simulated data, which might be biased as the real observation condition could be different from theoretical prediction or simulation. In this paper, we propose a theoretical and empirical integrated method, which first selects the possible optimal combined signals in theory and then refines these signals with real triple-frequency GPS data, observed at eleven baselines of different lengths. An interpolation technique is also adopted in order to show changes of the AR performance with the increase in baseline length. The results show that the AR success rate can be improved by 3% in GF mode and 8% in GB mode at certain intervals of the baseline length. Therefore, the TCAR can perform better by adopting the combined signals proposed in this paper when the baseline meets the length condition.},

abstract = {Using extended satellite gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), here we show that ice losses in southeast Greenland appear to have slowed down dramatically since late 2007, while those in the west, especially northwest Greenland show continued accelerations in recent years. Over the period April 2002 to November 2009, averaged ice loss rates in eastern Greenland (120 +/- 31 Gt/yr) are still significantly larger than those in the west (86.3 +/- 22 Gt/yr). However, the estimated ice loss rate from glaciers in northwest Greenland has increased from 30.9 +/- 8 Gt/yr over the first few years (2002–2005) to 128.2 +/- 33 Gt/yr for the more recent period (2007–2009), while the loss rate in southeast Greenland for the more recent period has become almost negligible, down from 109 +/- 28 Gt/yr of just a few years ago. The rapid change in the nature of the regional ice mass in southeast and northwest Greenland, in the course of only several years, further reinforces the idea that the Greenland ice sheet mass balance is very vulnerable to regional climate conditions. The dramatic slow down of ice loss in southeast Greenland observed by GRACE provides an independent verification of similar reports from other remote sensing data. The observed significant interannual variability of Greenland ice mass change suggests that it is very challenging to quantify Greenland's long-term ice mass change rates, and some observed apparent accelerations might simply be a reflection of the interannual variability.},

abstract = {Precise determination of local geoid is of particular importance for establishing height control in geodetic GNSS applications, since the classical leveling technique is too laborious. A geoid model can be accurately obtained employing properly distributed benchmarks having GNSS and leveling observations using an appropriate computing algorithm. Besides the classical multivariable polynomial regression equations (MPRE), this study attempts an evaluation of learning based computing algorithms: artificial neural networks (ANNs), adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and especially the wavelet neural networks (WNNs) approach in geoid surface approximation. These algorithms were developed parallel to advances in computer technologies and recently have been used for solving complex nonlinear problems of many applications. However, they are rather new in dealing with precise modeling problem of the Earth gravity field. In the scope of the study, these methods were applied to Istanbul GPS Triangulation Network data. The performances of the methods were assessed considering the validation results of the geoid models at the observation points. In conclusion the ANFIS and WNN revealed higher prediction accuracies compared to ANN and MPRE methods. Beside the prediction capabilities, these methods were also compared and discussed from the practical point of view in conclusions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.The current high-degree global geopotential models EGM2008 and EIGEN-6C4 resolve gravity field structures to ∼10 km spatial scales over most parts of the of Earth's surface. However, a notable exception is continental Antarctica, where the gravity information in these and other recent models is based on satellite gravimetry observations only, and thus limited to about ∼80–120 km spatial scales. Here, we present a new degree-2190 global gravity model (GGM) that for the first time improves the spatial resolution of the gravity field over the whole of continental Antarctica to ∼10 km spatial scales. The new model called SatGravRET2014 is a combination of recent Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite gravimetry with gravitational signals derived from the 2013 Bedmap2 topography/ice thickness/bedrock model with gravity forward modelling in ellipsoidal approximation. Bedmap2 is a significantly improved description of the topographic mass distribution over the Antarctic region based on a multitude of topographic surveys, and a well-suited source for modelling short-scale gravity signals as we show in our study. We describe the development of SatGravRET2014 which entirely relies on spherical harmonic modelling techniques. Details are provided on the least-squares combination procedures and on the conversion of topography to implied gravitational potential. The main outcome of our work is the SatGravRET2014 spherical harmonic series expansion to degree 2190, and derived high-resolution grids of 3D-synthesized gravity and quasigeoid effects over the whole of Antarctica. For validation, six data sets from the IAG Subcommission 2.4f “Gravity and Geoid in Antarctica” (AntGG) database were used comprising a total of 1,092,981 airborne gravimetric observations. All subsets consistently show that the Bedmap2-based short-scale gravity modelling improves the agreement over satellite-only data considerably (improvement rates ranging between 9 and 75 % with standard deviations from residuals between SatGravRET2014 and AntGG gravity ranging between 8 and 25 mGal). For comparison purposes, a degree-2190 GGM was generated based on the year-2001 Bedmap1 (using the ETOPO1 topography) instead of 2013 Bedmap2 topography product. Comparison of both GGMs against AntGG consistently reveals a closer fit over all test areas when Bedmap2 is used. This experiment provides evidence for clear improvements in Bedmap2 topographic information over Bedmap1 at spatial scales of ∼80–10 km, obtained from independent gravity data used as validation tool. As a general conclusion, our modelling effort fills—in approximation—some gaps in short-scale gravity knowledge over Antarctica and demonstrates the value of the Bedmap2 topography data for short-scale gravity refinement in GGMs. SatGravRET2014 can be used, e.g. as a reference model for future gravity modelling efforts over Antarctica, e.g. as foundation for a combination with the AntGG data set to obtain further improved gravity information.},

abstract = {This study developed, analyzed, and compared mission architectures for human exploration of Mars' moons within the context of an Evolvable Mars Campaign. METHODS: All trades assumed conjunction class missions to Phobos (approximately 500 days in Mars system) as it was considered the driving case for the transportation architecture. All architectures assumed that the Mars transit habitat would remain in a high-Mars orbit (HMO) with crewmembers transferring between HMO and Phobos in a small crew taxi vehicle. A reference science/exploration program was developed including performance of a standard set of tasks at 55 locations on the Phobos surface. Detailed EVA timelines were developed using realistic flight rules to accomplish the reference science tasks using exploration systems ranging from jetpacks to multi-person pressurized excursion vehicles combined with Phobos surface and orbital (L1, L4/L5, 20 km distant-retrograde-orbit [DRO]) habitat options. Detailed models of propellant mass, crew time, science productivity, radiation exposure, systems and consumables masses, and other figures of merit were integrated to enable quantitative comparison of different architectural options. Options for prestaging assets using solar electric propulsion versus delivering all systems with the crew were also evaluated. Seven discrete mission architectures were evaluated. RESULTS: The driving consideration for habitat location (Phobos surface versus orbital) was radiation exposure, with an estimated reduction in cumulative mission radiation exposure of up to 34% (versus a Mars orbital mission) when the habitat is located on the Phobos surface, compared with only 3% to 6% reduction for a habitat in a 20-km DRO. The exploration utility of lightweight unpressurized excursion vehicles was limited by the need to remain within 20 minutes of solar particle event radiation protection combined with complex guidance, navigation, and control systems required by the nonintuitive and highly-variable gravitational environment. Two-person pressurized excursion vehicles as well as mobile surface habitats offer significant exploration capability and operational benefits compared with unpressurized extravehicular activity (EVA) mobility systems at the cost of increased system and propellant mass. Mechanical surface translation modes (ie, hopping) were modeled and offered potentially significant propellant savings and the possibility of extended exploration operations between crewed missions. Options for extending the use of the crew taxi vehicle were examined, including use as an exploration asset for Phobos surface exploration (when combined with an alternate mobility system) and as an EVA platform, both on Phobos and for contingency EVA on the Mars transit habitat. CONCLUSIONS: Human exploration of Phobos offers a scientifically meaningful first step towards human Mars surface missions that develops and validates transportation, habitation, and exploration systems and operations in advance of the Mars landing systems.},

The behavior of the test mass and its capacitive feedback system is simulated in the time and the frequency domain for one degree of freedom. Only linear accelerations are considered so far. The second part of the analysis is about the practical implementation of the simulation model: Non-gravitational forces were derived from the GFZ (GeoForschungsZentrum) EPOS (Earth Parameter and Orbit System) software. In a closed loop the accelerometer measurements derived from these data in connection with simulated tracking data have been used for orbit recovery including the estimation of biases and scale factors for the accelerometer data. Details and results of this procedure are presented.Key words. GRACE ? sensor analysis ? accelerometer}},

GRACE measures a significant decrease in terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the central Amazon basin in the summer of 2005, relative to the average of the 5 other summer periods in the GRACE era. In contrast, data-assimilating climate and land surface models significantly underestimate the drought intensity. GRACE measurements are consistent with accumulated precipitation data from satellite remote sensing and are also supported by in situ water-level data from river gauge stations. This study demonstrates the unique potential of satellite gravity measurements in monitoring large-scale severe drought and flooding events and in evaluating advanced climate and land surface models.},

abstract = {The GRACE (gravity recovery and climate experiment) satellites, launched in March 2002, are each equipped with a BlackJack GPS onboard receiver for precise orbit determination and gravity field recovery. Since launch, there have been significant improvements in the background force models used for satellite orbit determination, most notably the model for the geopotential. This has resulted in significant improvements to orbit accuracy for very low altitude satellites. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how well the orbits of the GRACE satellites (about 470 km in altitude) can currently be determined using only GPS data and based on the current models and methods. The orbit accuracy is assessed using a number of tests, which include analysis of orbit fits, orbit overlaps, orbit connecting points, satellite Laser ranging residuals and K-band ranging (KBR) residuals. We show that 1-cm radial orbit accuracy for the GRACE satellites has probably been achieved. These precise GRACE orbits can be used for such purposes as improving gravity recovery from the GRACE KBR data and for atmospheric profiling, and they demonstrate the quality of the background force models being used.},

@article{Reguzzoni2014,
abstract = {The boundary between Earth's crust and mantle is commonly modelled as a discontinuity surface, the so-called Moho. Although in some regions of the world this model may be too approximate or even unrealistic, globally speaking it can provide a key to read several long wavelength geophysical signals. Recent research activities have shown the possibility to estimate the Moho discontinuity worldwide from global gravity field model, however usually the solution of this inverse problem requires strong unrealistic hypotheses. In this work a new procedure to relax some of these unrealistic hypotheses is devised and described in details. Basically it allows to estimate the mean Moho depth even once the normal gravitational field is removed if at least one seismic observation is available, to take into account the dependency of the crust density on the radial direction (usually neglected in Moho depth determination from gravity), to correct the a-priori density model of the crystalline crust for scale factors again using seismic information and finally to consider a Moho with a non-constant depth as reference surface in the inversion, thus reducing the linearization error. The new procedure is here applied to GOCE data to estimate a new crustal model. For this purpose additional external information has been used, such as topography, bathymetry and ice sheet models from ETOPO1, a recent 1°×1° sediment global model and some prior hypotheses on crustal density. In particular the main geological provinces, each of them characterized by its own relation between density and depth, have been considered. A model describing lateral density variations of the upper mantle is also taken into account. The new crustal model is computed at a spatial resolution of 0.5°×0.5°, its gravitational effect differs from GOCE observations of 49mE and its Moho depth error standard deviation is globally of 3.4km. Therefore the result seems to be an improvement in terms of resolution, consistency with the gravity field and accuracy not only with respect to previously released GEMMA models, but also with respect to the current state-of-the-art global knowledge of the Earth crust.},

During this time span temporal variations of the observable alias the measurement. Similar phenomenon can be defined in the space domain as well: data treated to refer to a geographical location often contains integrated information of the surroundings. In each case the appropriate signal content can partially be recovered by desmoothing the averaged data. The present study delivers the theoretical foundation of a desmoothing method, and suggests its use on different applications in geodesy. The theoretical formulation of the desmoothing has been derived for 1-D and 2-D signals, the latter is interpreted on a plain and also on a sphere. The presented case studies are less elaborated, but intended to demonstrate the need and usefulness of the desmoothing tool.},

@article{Baur2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Several techniques have been proposed to exploit GNSS-derived kinematic orbit information for the determination of long-wavelength gravity field features. These methods include the (i) celestial mechanics approach, (ii) short-arc approach, (iii) point-wise acceleration approach, (iv) averaged acceleration approach, and (v) energy balance approach. Although there is a general consensus that—except for energy balance—these methods theoretically provide equivalent results, real data gravity field solutions from kinematic orbit analysis have never been evaluated against each other within a consistent data processing environment. This contribution strives to close this gap. Target consistency criteria for our study are the input data sets, period of investigation, spherical harmonic resolution, a priori gravity field information, etc. We compare GOCE gravity field estimates based on the aforementioned approaches as computed at the Graz University of Technology, the University of Bern, the University of Stuttgart/Austrian Academy of Sciences, and by RHEA Systems for the European Space Agency. The involved research groups complied with most of the consistency criterions. Deviations only occur where technical unfeasibility exists. Performance measures include formal errors, differences with respect to a state-of-the-art GRACE gravity field, (cumulative) geoid height differences, and SLR residuals from precise orbit determination of geodetic satellites. We found that for the approaches (i) to (iv), the cumulative geoid height differences at spherical harmonic degree 100 differ by only ≈10 %; in the absence of the polar data gap, SLR residuals agree by ≈96 %. From our investigations, we conclude that real data analysis results are in agreement with the theoretical considerations concerning the (relative) performance of the different approaches.},

The equations are fully three dimensional and allow for the integration of the spin, the orbit, and the deformation of each body. The goal is to present good models for the tidal forces that take into account the possibly different rheology of each body. The equations are obtained within a finite dimension Lagrangian framework with dissipation function. The main contribution is a procedure to associate to each spring–dashpot model, which defines the rheology of a body, a potential and a dissipation function for the body deformation variables. The theory is applied to the Earth (solid part plus oceans) and a comparison between model and observation of the following quantities is made: norm of the Love numbers, rate of tidal energy dissipation, Chandler period, and Earth–Moon distance increase.},

abstract = {Cycle slip detection and correction are important issues when carrier phase observations are used in high-precision GNSS data processing and have, therefore, been intensively investigated. Along with the GNSS modernization, the cycle slip correction (CSC) problem has been raised to deal with more signals from multi-frequencies. We extend the geometry-based approach by integrating time-differenced pseudorange and carrier phase observations to estimate the integer number of triple-frequency cycle slips together with the receiver clock offset, ionospheric delay variations and receiver displacements. The Least-squares AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment method can be employed. The benefit of the third frequency observation on the cycle slip estimate is first investigated with simulation tests. The results show that adding the third frequency observation can significantly improve the model strength and that a reliable triple-frequency CSC with a theoretical success rate of higher than 99.9 % can still be achieved, even under the condition that the range or ionosphere delay variation is poorly defined. The performance of triple-frequency CSC is validated with real triple-frequency BDS data since all BDS satellites in orbit are transmitting triple-frequency signals. The results show that the fixing rate of CSC can reach 99.1 % in static precise point positioning (PPP) and 98.8 % in the kinematic case. PPP solutions with cycle slip-uncorrected and cycle slip-corrected data sets are compared to validate the correctness of triple-frequency CSC. The standard deviations of the PPP solution in east, north and vertical component, respectively, can be improved by 31.1, 30.7 and 37.6 % for static, and by 42.0, 53.8 and 39.7 % for kinematic after cycle slips are corrected. The performance of dual- and triple-frequency CSC is also compared. Results show that the performance of dual-frequency CSC is slightly worse than that of triple-frequency CSC. These results demonstrate that the performance of CSC can be significantly improved with triple-frequency observations.},

The circular motion of massive particles is discussed in the new metric. It is shown that there are two roots at which circular motion can happen. However, while one root results in a stable circular orbit, the second represents a maxima which is very unstable because the attractive forces dominate as radius r$r$ gets small and draw towards zero. Furthermore, we derive an equation for the orbital angular speed for the stable root in modified gravity and show that for large values of M$M$, the modified orbital angular speed approaches the well known orbital angular speed. Finally, a description of photon orbits in the new metric is given and a derivation of the deflection angle is presented. Its shown that modified gravity can give a considerable contribution to the deflection angles of light rays.},

abstract = {In this article, the realization of a global terrestrial reference system (TRS) based on a consistent combination of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) is studied. Our input data consists of normal equation systems from 17 years (1994–2010) of homogeneously reprocessed GPS, GLONASS and SLR data. This effort used common state of the art reduction models and the same processing software (Bernese GNSS Software) to ensure the highest consistency when combining GNSS and SLR. Residual surface load deformations are modeled with a spherical harmonic approach. The estimated degree-1 surface load coefficients have a strong annual signal for which the GNSS- and SLR-only solutions show very similar results. A combination including these coefficients reduces systematic uncertainties in comparison to the single-technique solution. In particular, uncertainties due to solar radiation pressure modeling in the coefficient time series can be reduced up to 50 % in the GNSS+SLR solution compared to the GNSS-only solution. In contrast to the ITRF2008 realization, no local ties are used to combine the different geodetic techniques. We combine the pole coordinates as global ties and apply minimum constraints to define the geodetic datum. We show that a common origin, scale and orientation can be reliably realized from our combination strategy in comparison to the ITRF2008.},

@article{Rodriguez-Solano2012,
abstract = {One of the major uncertainty sources affecting Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite orbits is the direct solar radiation pressure. In this paper a new model for the solar radiation pressure on GPS satellites is presented that is based on a box-wing satellite model, and assumes nominal attitude. The box-wing model is based on the physical interaction between solar radiation and satellite surfaces, and can be adjusted to fit the GPS tracking data. To compensate the effects of solar radiation pressure, the International GNSS Service (IGS) analysis centers employ a variety of approaches, ranging from purely empirical models based on in-orbit behavior, to physical models based on pre-launch spacecraft structural analysis. It has been demonstrated, however, that the physical models fail to predict the real orbit behavior with sufficient accuracy, mainly due to deviations from nominal attitude, inaccurately known optical properties, or aging of the satellite surfaces. The adjustable box-wing model presented in this paper is an intermediate approach between the physical/analytical models and the empirical models. The box-wing model fits the tracking data by adjusting mainly the optical properties of the satellite's surfaces. In addition, the so called Y-bias and a parameter related to a rotation lag angle of the solar panels around their rotation axis (about 1.5° for Block II/IIA and 0.5° for Block IIR) are estimated. This last parameter, not previously identified for GPS satellites, is a key factor for precise orbit determination. For this study GPS orbits are generated based on one year (2007) of tracking data, with the processing scheme derived from the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE). Two solutions are computed, one using the adjustable box-wing model and one using the CODE empirical model. Using this year of data the estimated parameters and orbits are analyzed. The performance of the models is comparable, when looking at orbit overlap and orbit prediction errors. Nevertheless, the models show important differences between orbits at the 1–2cm level and total accelerations (up to 5×10-9m/s2).

abstract = {We examine the scale and spatial distribution of the mass change acceleration in Greenland and its statistical significance, using processed gravimetric data from the GRACE mission for the period 2002-2011. Three different data products - the CNES/GRGS, DMT-1b and GGFC GRACE solutions - have been used, all revealing an accelerating mass loss in Greenland, though with significant local differences between the three datasets. Compensating for leakage effects, we obtain acceleration values of -18.6 Gt / yr2 for CNES/GRGS, -8.8 Gt / yr2 for DMT-1b, and -14.8 Gt / yr2 for GGFC.We find considerable mass loss acceleration in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, some of which will leak into the values for Greenland, depending on the approach used, and for our computations the leakage has been estimated at up to -4.7 Gt / yr2.The length of the time series of the GRACE data makes a huge difference in establishing an acceleration of the data. For both 10-day and monthly GRACE solutions, an observed acceleration on the order of 10 - 20 Gt / yr2 is shown to require more than 5 yrs of data to establish with statistical significance.In order to provide an independent evaluation, ICESat laser altimetry data have been smoothed to match the resolution of the GRACE solutions. This gives us an estimated upper bound for the acceleration of about -29.7 Gt / yr2 for the period 2003-2009, consistent with the acceleration values and corresponding confidence intervals found with GRACE data. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {EUREF, the Sub-commission for the Euro-pean Reference Frame within IAG Commission 1, in cooperation with the European Geoid and Gravity Project (EGGP), is developing a homogeneous continental GPS/leveling database. EUVN_DA, the Densification Action of the EUVN (European Unified Vertical Reference Network) project is designed to support the development of the new European geoid solutions and to contribute to the realization of an accurate continental height reference surface. The cm-accuracy GPS/leveling database could also be used for the realization of the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) and for the analysis of the national height networks. The establishment of the EUVN_DA network was started in 2003. The database now consists of about 1,500 high quality GPS/leveling points contributed from 25 countries. The GPS coordinates refer to the realizations of the ETRS89 and the leveling data to EVRS2007. Most of the EUVN_DA benchmarks are integrated into the UELN (United European Leveling Network) to assure the long term homogeneity and consistency of the height information. The GPS database mostly relies on existing measurements which fulfilled pre-defined quality requirements. The main phase of the project terminates by the end of 2008, but the periodic maintenance of the database is planned on long term. This paper summarizes the activities within the EUVN_DA project, gives an overview on the actual status and presents the results on the analysis of the continental geoid solutions. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

Here, we show for the first time that refined deformation signals from the 2004 December 26 Sumatra–Andaman Earthquake (Mw 9.1–9.3) together with the 2005 March 28 Nias earthquake (Mw 8.6) can be revealed by deriving the full gravitational gradient tensor from GRACE monthly gravitational field. The GRACE-inferred coseismic gravitational gradient changes agree well with coseismic slip model predictions. Since the high-frequency contents in gravitational field variation can be amplified by deriving the gravitational gradients, the GRACE-derived coseismic gravitational gradient changes clearly delineate the fault lines, locate significant slips, and better define the extent of the coseismic deformation.},

@article{Anderson2012,
abstract = {It has been found that the {DMSP} spacecraft at 840 km can charge to very large negative voltages (up to −2000 V) when encountering intense precipitating electron events (auroral arcs). We present an 11-year study of over 1600 charging events, defined as when the spacecraft charged to levels exceeding 100 V negative during an auroral crossing. The occurrence frequency of events was highly correlated with the 11-year solar cycle with the largest number of events occurring during solar minimum. This was due to the requirement that the background thermal plasma density be low, at most 104 cm−3. During solar maximum, the plasma density is typically well above that level due to the solar {EUV} ionizing radiation, and although the occurrence frequency of auroral arcs is considerably greater than at solar minimum, the occurrence of high-level charging is minimal. As a result of this study, we produced a model spectrum for precipitating electrons that can be used as a specification for the low-altitude auroral charging environment. There are implications from this study on a number of {LEO} satellite programs, including the International Space Station, which does enter the auroral zone, particularly during geomagnetic activity when the auroral boundary can penetrate to very low latitudes. The plasma density in the {ISS} orbit is usually well above the minimum required density for charging. However, in the wake of the {ISS,} the plasma density can be 2 orders of magnitude or more lower than the background density and thus conditions are ripe for charging.},

abstract = {The Northwest India Aquifer (NWIA) has been shown to have the highest groundwater depletion (GWD) rate globally, threatening crop production and sustainability of groundwater resources. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have been emerging as a powerful tool to evaluate GWD with ancillary data. Accurate GWD estimation is, however, challenging because of uncertainties in GRACE data processing. We evaluated GWD rates over the NWIA using a variety of approaches, including newly developed constrained forward modeling resulting in a GWD rate of 3.1 ± 0.1 cm/a (or 14 ± 0.4 km(3)/a) for Jan 2005-Dec 2010, consistent with the GWD rate (2.8 cm/a or 12.3 km(3)/a) from groundwater-level monitoring data. Published studies (e.g., 4 ± 1 cm/a or 18 ± 4.4 km(3)/a) may overestimate GWD over this region. This study highlights uncertainties in GWD estimates and the importance of incorporating a priori information to refine spatial patterns of GRACE signals that could be more useful in groundwater resource management and need to be paid more attention in future studies.},

abstract = {Growing evidence has demonstrated the importance of ice shelf buttressing on the inland grounded ice, especially if it is resting on bedrock below sea level. Much of the Southern Antarctic Peninsula satisfies this condition and also possesses a bed slope that deepens inland. Such ice sheet geometry is potentially unstable. We use satellite altimetry and gravity observations to show that a major portion of the region has, since 2009, destabilized. Ice mass loss of the marine-terminating glaciers has rapidly accelerated from close to balance in the 2000s to a sustained rate of –56 +− 8 gigatons per year, constituting a major fraction of Antarctica's contribution to rising sea level. The widespread, simultaneous nature of the acceleration, in the absence of a persistent atmospheric forcing, points to an oceanic driving mechanism.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel concept of an air bearing test bench for CubeSat ground testing together with the corresponding dynamic parameter identification method. Contrary to existing air bearing test benches, the proposed concept allows three degree-of-freedom unlimited rotations and minimizes the influence of the test bench on the tested CubeSat. These advantages are made possible by the use of a robotic wrist which rotates air bearings in order to make them follow the CubeSat motion. Another keystone of the test bench is an accurate balancing of the tested CubeSat. Indeed, disturbing factors acting on the satellite shall be minimized, the most significant one being the gravity torque. An efficient balancing requires the CubeSat center of mass position to be accurately known. Usual techniques of dynamic parameter identification cannot be directly applied because of the frictionless suspension of the CubeSat in the test bench and, accordingly, due to the lack of external actuation. In this paper, a new identification method is proposed. This method does not require any external actuation and is based on the sampling of free oscillating motions of the CubeSat mounted on the test bench.},

abstract = {To study the sub-seasonal distribution and generation of ocean mass anomalies, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations of daily and monthly resolution are assimilated into a global ocean circulation model with an ensemble-based Kalman-Filter technique. The satellite gravimetry observations are processed to become time-variable fields of ocean mass distribution. Error budgets for the observations and the ocean model's initial state are estimated which contain the full covariance information. The consistency of the presented approach is demonstrated by increased agreement between GRACE observations and the ocean model. Furthermore, the simulations are compared with independent observations from 54 bottom pressure recorders. The assimilation improves the agreement to high-latitude recorders by up to 2 hPa. The improvements are caused by assimilation-induced changes in the atmospheric wind forcing, i.e., quantities not directly observed by GRACE. Finally, the use of the developed Kalman-Filter approach as a destriping filter to remove artificial noise contaminating the GRACE observations is presented.},

abstract = {Weekly ocean bottom pressure anomalies (OBP) are modeled using the\nFinite Element Sea-ice Ocean Model (FESOM). The model's OBP error,\nmostly unknown so far, is assessed by comparing two model simulations,\neach forced by different atmospheric forcing data sets. The mean\nestimated error of modeled OBP is found to be 0.04 m per 1.5��1.5�grid\ncell. The error varies strongly from 0.003 m in the equatorial region\nto 0.31 m in the Weddell and Ross Seas.

abstract = {Data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) have significantly improved our knowledge of the terrestrial water cycle. With the availability of GRACE data from 2002, we are now able to even perform climate change studies with respect to water storage variations. However, as GRACE is already after its predicted lifetime by many years, thus increasing the risk of a possible gap in regular observations of the total water storage changes until GRACE Follow-On becomes operational in 2017. We have to find methods for filling the gaps of both past data and also until the launch of GRACE Follow On. One idea could be finding the relation between the water storage anomaly that is derived from GRACE and hydrologic parameters like precipitation to estimate and assimilate the missing data of GRACE using copula-based analysis. In this study, we therefore analyze the potential of copula-based methods for simulating GRACE data from other hydrological data sources.},

abstract = {The state of art of Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (SST) as a method for the recovery of the medium and short wavelength features of the earth's gravity field is briefly discussed in comparison to satellite altimetry and gradiometry. The analysis of the basic equations connecting the measured radial velocities with the unknown parameters shows that by measuring some additional quantities, a self-contained SST low-low system would be feasible; the low-low configuration could in essence sense the gravity tensor in the direction connecting the two satellites; and the two satellites should orbit one above the other in radial direction. Severe problems for the realization of a low-low experiment are expected from the influences of non-gravitational forces and their proper compensation. The method of gravity parameter recovery implies two improperly posed problems, one of them the downward continuation to the surface of the earth. A hybrid regularization model for the proper treatment of this problem is compared with a sequential model. Some requirements for a SST experiment to be optimally suited for gravity parameter recovery are presented.},

abstract = {The continuous evolution of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) meteorology has led to an increased use of associated observations for operational modern low-latency numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, which assimilate GNSS-derived zenith total delay (ZTD) estimates. The development of NWP models with faster assimilation cycles, e.g., 1-h assimilation cycle in the rapid update cycle NWP model, has increased the interest of the meteorological community toward sub-hour ZTD estimates. The suitability of real-time ZTD estimates obtained from three different precise point positioning software packages has been assessed by comparing them with the state-of-the-art IGS final troposphere product as well as collocated radiosonde (RS) observations. The ZTD estimates obtained by BNC2.7 show a mean bias of 0.21 cm, and those obtained by the G-Nut/Tefnut software library show a mean bias of 1.09 cm to the IGS final troposphere product. In comparison with the RS-based ZTD, the BNC2.7 solutions show mean biases between 1 and 2 cm, whereas the G-Nut/Tefnut solutions show mean biases between 2 and 3 cm with the RS-based ZTD, and the ambiguity float and ambiguity fixed solutions obtained by PPP-Wizard have mean biases between 6 and 7 cm with the references. The large biases in the time series from PPP-Wizard are due to the fact that this software has been developed for kinematic applications and hence does not apply receiver antenna eccentricity and phase center offset (PCO) corrections on the observations. Application of the eccentricity and PCO corrections to the a priori coordinates has resulted in a 66 % reduction of bias in the PPP-Wizard solutions. The biases are found to be stable over the whole period of the comparison, which are criteria (rather than the magnitude of the bias) for the suitability of ZTD estimates for use in NWP nowcasting. A millimeter-level impact on the ZTD estimates has also been observed in relation to ambiguity resolution. As a result of a comparison with the established user requirements for NWP nowcasting, it was found that both the G-Nut/Tefnut solutions and one of the BNC2.7 solutions meet the threshold requirements, whereas one of the BNC2.7 solution and both the PPP-Wizard solutions currently exceed this threshold.},

abstract = {The gravity anomaly field over the whole Earth obtained by the GOCE satellite is a revolutionary tool to reveal geologic information on a continental scale for the large areas where conventional gravity mea-surements have yet to be made. It is, however, necessary to isolate the near-surface geologic signal from the contributions of thickness variations in the crust and lithosphere and the isostatic compensation of surface relief. Here Africa is studied with particular emphasis on selected geological features which are expected to appear as density inhomogeneities. These include cratons and fold belts in the Precam-brian basement, the overlying sedimentary basins and magmatism, as well as the continental margins. Regression analysis between gravity and topography shows coefficients that are consistently positive forthe free air gravity anomaly and negative for the Bouguer gravity anomaly. The error and scatter on the regression are smallest in oceanic areas, where it is a possible tool for identifying changes in crustal type. The regression analysis allows the large gradient in the Bouguer anomaly signal across continental margins to be removed. After subtracting the predicted effect of known topography from the original Bouguer anomaly field, the residual field shows a continent-wide pattern of anomalies that could be attributed toregional geological structures. A few of these are highlighted, such as those representing Karoo magmatism, the Kibalian foldbelt, the Zimbabwe Craton, the Cameroon and Tibesti volcanic deposits, the Benue Trough and the Luangwa Rift. A reconstruction of the pre-break up position of Africa and South America (the plates forming West Gondwana) is made for the residual GOCE gravity field. The reconstruction allows the positive and negative anomalies to be compared across the continental fragments, and sohelps identify common geologic units that extend across both the now-separate continents.},

abstract = {High-frequency variability of the ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) can strongly affect precise positioning with GNSS. The occurrence rate as well as the amplitude of such disturbances has been extensively studied over the last decade. Mainly, one can distinguish disturbances due to space-weather events and the others, qualified as "quiet-time" as they are observed during quiet geomagnetic conditions. The latter, which represent more than 75% of the total number of disturbances over mid-latitudes, are then divided into two categories: the Winter Daytime (WD) and the Summer Nighttime (SN). The first category, representing the bulk of quiet-time disturbances, corresponds to classical Medium-Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs), that are the result of the interaction of gravity waves and the ionospheric plasma. On the other hand, SN disturbances are generally understood as non-classical MSTIDs of electrical origin. The paper investigates the origin of these two types of disturbance based on GPS measurements, ionospheric soundings and wind speed data at a tropospheric level. If one cannot exclude the solar terminator as a potential source of gravity waves responsible for WD events, it is thought that the major contribution comes from the lower atmosphere. More precisely, tropospheric jetstream is considered as the favorite candidate for daytime MSTIDs. Turning to SN disturbances, our analysis reveals that they are related to spread-F phenomenon, linked to the appearance of sporadic E-layers. The related instabilities are responsible for field-aligned irregularities in the F-region, which are thought to be responsible for noise-like fluctuations of the GPS TEC observed during SN events.},

abstract = {During the 1990s, a large number of new tidal atlases were developed, primarily to provide accurate tidal corrections for satellite altimetry applications. During this decade, the French tidal group (FTG), led by C. Le Provost, produced a series of finite element solutions (FES) tidal atlases, among which FES2004 is the latest release, computed from the tidal hydrodynamic equations and data assimilation. The aim of this paper is to review the state of the art of tidal modelling and the progress achieved during this past decade. The first sections summarise the general FTG approach to modelling the global tides. In the following sections, we introduce the FES2004 tidal atlas and validate the model against in situ and satellite data. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of the FES2004 release compared to earlier FES tidal atlases, and we recommend its use in tidal applications. The final section focuses on the new dissipation term added to the equations, which aims to account for the conversion of barotropic energy into internal tidal energy. There is a huge improvement in the hydrodynamic tidal solution and energy budget obtained when this term is taken into account.},

abstract = {We use GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) and ERA-interim air temperature, as proxy for available water and temperature constraints on vegetation productivity, inferred from MODIS satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), in Northern Eurasia during 2002-2011. We investigate how changes in TWS affect the correlation between NDVI and temperature during the non-frozen season. We find that vegetation growth exhibits significant spatial and temporal variability associated with varying trend in TWS and temperature. The largest NDVI gains occur over boreal forests associated with warming and wetting. The largest NDVI losses occur over grasslands in the Southwestern Ob associated with regional drying and cooling, with dominant constraint from TWS. Over grasslands and temperate forests in the Southeast Ob and South Yenisei, wetting and cooling lead to a dominant temperature constraint due to the relaxation of TWS constraints. Overall, we find significant monthly correlation of NDVI with TWS and temperature over 35% and 50% of the domain, respectively. These results indicate that water availability (TWS) plays a major role in modulating Eurasia vegetation response to temperature changes.},

abstract = {Since April 2011, the thermal control of the accelerometers on board the GRACE satellites has been turned off. The time series of along-track bias clearly show a drastic change in the behaviour of this parameter, while the calibration model has remained unchanged throughout the entire mission lifetime. In an effort to improve the quality of the gravity field models produced at CSR in future mission-long re-processing of GRACE data, we quantify the added value of different calibration strategies. In one approach, the temperature effects that distort the raw accelerometer measurements collected without thermal control are corrected considering the housekeeping temperature readings. In this way, one single calibration strategy can be consistently applied during the whole mission lifetime, since it is valid to thermal the conditions before and after April 2011. Finally, we illustrate that the resulting calibrated accelerations are suitable for neutral thermospheric density studies.},

abstract = {Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provides monthly solutions for the Earth's gravity field in the form of spherical harmonic coefficients. These can be used to infer changes in mass at the Earth's surface. The pole tide (the response of the Earth and oceans to polar motion) causes gravity signals dominated by harmonics of degree 2, order 1. If the pole tide is not removed from GRACE data, it affects the coefficients of those harmonics (C21, S21) and introduces errors when using those coefficients to determine surface mass variations. The pole tide is partially removed by GRACE processing centers before solving for the gravity field. But long-period pole tide signals are not usually included in the GRACE pole tide correction, and so those signals are still present in the GRACE coefficients. We discuss this issue from the standpoint of somebody who uses the GRACE gravity fields to infer changes in surface mass. We arrive at a recommendation for an optimal GRACE pole tide correction. We describe how to modify the C21, S21 coefficients provided by the processing centers, so that they conform with our recommendation. We discuss the size of the pole tide contributions to C21, S21, compared to those of the direct load-induced contributions. As an example, we show how an incompletely removed pole tide can impact GRACE results for the trend in ocean mass. We consider the impact of mantle anelasticity on long-period pole tide corrections and conclude that it is unlikely to affect those corrections by more than 20%.},

abstract = {Thirteen years of GRACE data provide an excellent picture of the current mass changes of Greenland and Antarctica, with mass loss in the GRACE period 2002--2015 amounting to 265 {\textpm} 25 GT/year for Greenland (including peripheral ice caps), and 95 {\textpm} 50 GT/year for Antarctica, corresponding to 0.72 and 0.26 mm/year average global sea level change. A significant acceleration in mass loss rate is found, especially for Antarctica, while Greenland mass loss, after a corresponding acceleration period, and a record mass loss in the summer of 2012, has seen a slight decrease in short-term mass loss trend. The yearly mass balance estimates, based on point mass inversion methods, have relatively large errors, both due to uncertainties in the glacial isostatic adjustment processes, especially for Antarctica, leakage from unmodelled ocean mass changes, and (for Greenland) difficulties in separating mass signals from the Greenland ice sheet and the adjacent Canadian ice caps. The limited resolution of GRACE affects the uncertainty of total mass loss to a smaller degree; we illustrate the ``real'' sources of mass changes by including satellite altimetry elevation change results in a joint inversion with GRACE, showing that mass change occurs primarily associated with major outlet glaciers, as well as a narrow coastal band. For Antarctica, the primary changes are associated with the major outlet glaciers in West Antarctica (Pine Island and Thwaites Glacier systems), as well as on the Antarctic Peninsula, where major glacier accelerations have been observed after the 2002 collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf.},

abstract = {The gravitational ?eld of the Earth is caused by the heterogeneous mass distribution of the Earth. Due to this ?eld, the mean sea level (at rest) shows ?uctuations (geoid heights) up to 100 meters with respect to a reference ellipsoid. The time-varying gravity signal is a source of information on the melting of the polar ice, the hydrological cycle and other mass variations within the Earth. Moreover, the gravity ?eld of the Earth is needed to derive the physical (orthometric) heights and to estimate the ocean at rest, which is necessary for oceanographic research. The gravitational ?eld is an harmonic ?eld and can be expressed in a model of spherical harmonic coef?cients. A higher resolution can be obtained by an increase in this number of coef?cients; e.g., more than 130,000 coef?cients are needed for a resolution of 111 kilometers. Traditional techniques for the determination of this gravity ?eld are terrestrial measurements, marine measurements and airborne gravimetry. Since the launch of the ?rst satellite in 1957, satellite tracking measurements are used to derive the gravitational ?eld, together with altimetry measurements to estimate the sea surface at rest. With the launch of the dedicated satellite missions CHAMP (2000), GRACE (2002) and the upcoming GOCE mission (2008), millions of observations have become available, which will (and allready have) improved the gravitational ?eld by several orders. Moreover, the measurements of theGRACE mission enable us to derive monthly estimates of the mass changes in a thin shell near the Earth's surface, mainly due to hydrology, post-glacial rebound and the melting of the polar ice. The combination of different observation groups (satellite / surface gravity data) raises a number of research questions},

abstract = {<p>The Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest potential source of future sea-level rise. Mass loss has been increasing over the last 2 decades for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) but with significant discrepancies between estimates, especially for the Antarctic Peninsula. Most of these estimates utilise geophysical models to explicitly correct the observations for (unobserved) processes. Systematic errors in these models introduce biases in the results which are difficult to quantify. In this study, we provide a statistically rigorous error-bounded trend estimate of ice mass loss over the WAIS from 2003 to 2009 which is almost entirely data driven. Using altimetry, gravimetry, and GPS data in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we derive spatial fields for ice mass change, surface mass balance, and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) without relying explicitly on forward models. The approach we use separates mass and height change contributions from different processes, reproducing spatial features found in, for example, regional climate and GIA forward models, and provides an independent estimate which can be used to validate and test the models. In addition, spatial error estimates are derived for each field. The mass loss estimates we obtain are smaller than some recent results, with a time-averaged mean rate of −76 ± 15 Gt yr<sup>−1</sup> for the WAIS and Antarctic Peninsula, including the major Antarctic islands. The GIA estimate compares well with results obtained from recent forward models (IJ05-R2) and inverse methods (AGE-1). The Bayesian framework is sufficiently flexible that it can, eventually, be used for the whole of Antarctica, be adapted for other ice sheets and utilise data from other sources such as ice cores, accumulation radar data, and other measurements that contain information about any of the processes that are solved for.</p>},

abstract = {Since its launch in March 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has provided a global mapping of the time-variations of the Earths gravity field. Tiny variations of gravity from monthly to decadal time scales are mainly due to redistributions of water mass inside the surface fluid envelops of our planet (i.e., atmosphere, ocean and water storage on continents). In this article, we present a review of the major contributions of GRACE satellite gravimetry in global and regional hydrology. To date, many studies have focused on the ability of GRACE to detect, for the very first time, the time-variations of continental water storage (including surface waters, soil moisture, groundwater, as well as snow pack at high latitudes) at the unprecedented resolution of $\sim$400-500 km. As no global complete network of surface hydrological observations exists, the advances of satellite gravimetry to monitor terrestrial water storage are significant and unique for determining changes in total water storage and water balance closure at regional and continental scales.},

Both approaches are implemented in the proposed ARNS described in this paper. An innovative phase integer ambiguity fixing and feedback scheme is implemented to increase the ambiguity fix rate of the GPS carrier phase measurements.

abstract = {Observations of volcanic subsidence have contributed to our understanding of the eruption cycle, hydrothermal systems and the formation of continental crust. Lassen Volcanic Center is one of two volcanoes in the southern Cascades known to have subsided in recent decades, but the onset, temporal evolution, and cause of subsidence remain unconstrained. Here we use multiple sets of InSAR data, each corrected using the North American Regional Reanalysis atmospheric model, to determine the temporal and spatial characteristics of deformation between 1992 and 2010. Throughout this period all datasets reveal subsidence of a broad, 30-40 km wide region at rates of $\sim$10 mm/yr. Evaluating past geodetic studies we suggest that subsidence may have been ongoing since the 1980s, before which it is unlikely that significant ground deformation occurred. By combining multiple tracks of InSAR data we find that the ratio of horizontal to vertical displacements is high (up to 3:1), and source inversions favour a point source located at $\sim$8 km depth. Time-series analysis suggests that the rate of volume change of this source may have varied over time. The source geometry and the temporal evolution of deformation contrasts to subsidence observed at nearby Medicine Lake Volcano since the 1950s. We evaluate possible causes of subsidence at Lassen Volcanic Center in light of tectonic setting and hydrothermal activity, and suggest that regional GPS measurements will be key to understanding the role of crustal extension plus other hydrothermal/magmatic processes in deformation during recent decades.},

abstract = {A realistically perturbed synthetic de-aliasing model consistent with the updated Earth System Model of the European Space Agency is now available over the period 1995--2006. The dataset contains realizations of (1) errors at large spatial scales assessed individually for periods 10--30, 3--10, and 1--3 days, the S1 atmospheric tide, and sub-diurnal periods; (2) errors at small spatial scales typically not covered by global models of atmosphere and ocean variability; and (3) errors due to physical processes not represented in currently available de-aliasing products. The model is provided in two separate sets of Stokes coefficients to allow for a flexible re-scaling of the overall error level to account for potential future improvements in atmosphere and ocean mass variability models. Error magnitudes for the different frequency bands are derived from a small ensemble of four atmospheric and oceanic models. For the largest spatial scales up to $\${\backslash}hbox {d/o} = 40$$ d/o = 40 and periods longer than 24 h, those error estimates are approximately confirmed from a variance component estimation based on GRACE daily normal equations. Future mission performance simulations based on the updated Earth System Model and the realistically perturbed de-aliasing model indicate that for GRACE-type missions only moderate reductions of de-aliasing errors can be expected from a second satellite pair in a shifted polar orbit. Substantially more accurate global gravity fields are obtained when a second pair of satellites in an moderately inclined orbit is added, which largely stabilizes the global gravity field solutions due to its rotated sampling sensitivity.},

abstract = {We present the joint estimation model for Global Positioning System/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (GPS/BDS) real-time clocks and present the initial satellite clock solutions determined from 106 stations of the international GNSS service multi-GNSS experiment and the BeiDou experimental tracking stations networks for 1 month in December, 2012. The model is shown to be efficient enough to have no practical computational limit for producing 1-Hz clock updates for real-time applications. The estimated clocks were assessed through the comparison with final clock products and the analysis of post-fit residuals. Using the estimated clocks and corresponding orbit products (GPS ultra-rapid-predicted and BDS final orbits), the root-mean-square (RMS) values of coordinate differences from ground truth values are around 1 and 2–3 cm for GPS-only and BDS-only daily mean static precise point positioning (PPP) solutions, respectively. Accuracy of GPS/BDS combined static PPP solutions falls in between that of GPS-only and BDS-only PPP results, with RMS values approximately 1–2 cm in all three components. For static sites, processed in the kinematic PPP mode, the daily RMS values are normally within 4 and 6 cm after convergence for GPS-only and BDS-only results, respectively. In contrast, the combined GPS/BDS kinematic PPP solutions show higher accuracy and shorter convergence time. Additionally, the BDS-only kinematic PPP solutions using clock products derived from the proposed joint estimation model were superior compared to those computed using the single-system estimation model.},

This estimate agrees remarkably well with a recent assessment of –224 ± 41 cubic kilometers per year, based on satellite radar interferometry data.

@article{Winsemius2006b,
abstract = {Variations of water stocks in the upper Zambezi river basin have been determined by 2 different hydrologi- cal modelling approaches. The purpose was to provide pre- liminary terrestrial storage estimates in the upper Zambezi, which will be compared with estimates derived from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) in a future study. The first modelling approach is GIS-based, dis- tributed and conceptual (STREAM). The second approach uses Lumped Elementary Watersheds identified and mod- elled conceptually (LEW). The STREAM model structure has been assessed using GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Un- certainty Estimation) a posteriori to determine parameter identifiability. The LEW approach could, in addition, be tested for model structure, because computational efforts of LEW are low. Both models are threshold models, where the non-linear behaviour of the Zambezi river basin is explained by a com- bination of thresholds and linear reservoirs. The models were forced by time series of gauged and in- terpolated rainfall. Where available, runoff station data was used to calibrate the models. Ungauged watersheds were generally given the same parameter sets as their neighbour- ing calibrated watersheds. It appeared that the LEW model structure could be im- proved by applying GLUE iteratively. Eventually, it led to better identifiability of parameters and consequently a better model structure than the STREAM model. Hence, the final model structure obtained better represents the true hydrology. After calibration, both models show a comparable effi- ciency in representing discharge. However the LEW model shows a far greater storage amplitude than the STREAM model. This emphasizes the storage uncertainty related to hydrological modelling in data-scarce environments such as the Zambezi river basin. It underlines the need and potential for independent observations of terrestrial storage to enhance our understanding and modelling capacity of the hydrologi- cal processes. GRACE could provide orthogonal information that can help to constrain and further enhance our models. In the near future, other remotely sensed data sources will be used to force modelling efforts of the Zambezi (e.g. satellite rainfall estimates) and to identify individual storage compo- nents in the GRACE observations (e.g. altimeter lake levels and microwave soil moisture). Ultimately, this will create possibilities for state updating of regional hydrological mod- els using GRACE.},

abstract = {The GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) gravity field satellite mission was launched in 2002. Although many investigations have been carried out, not all disturbances and perturbations upon satellite instruments and sensors are resolved yet. In this work the issue of acceleration disturbances onboard of GRACE due to magnetic torquers is investigated and discussed. Each of the GRACE satellites is equipped with a three-axes capacitive accelerometer to measure non-gravitational forces acting on the spacecraft. We used 10 Hz Level 1a raw accelerometer data in order to determine the impact of electric current changes on the accelerometer. After reducing signals which are induced by highly dominating processes in the low frequency range, such as thermospheric drag and solar radiation pressure, which can easily be done by applying a high-pass filter, disturbing signals from onboard instruments such as thruster firing events or heater switch events need to be removed from the previously filtered data. Afterwards the spikes which are induced by the torquers can be very well observed. Spikes vary in amplitude with respect to an increasing or decreasing current used for magnetic torquers, and can be as large as 20 nm/s 2. Furthermore, we were able to set up a model for the spikes of each scenario with which we were able to compute model spike time series. With these time series the spikes can successfully be removed from the 10 Hz raw accelerometer data. Spectral analysis of the time series reveal that an influence onto gravity field determination due to these effects is very unlikely, but can theoretically not be excluded. ?? 2012 COSPAR.

Numerical experiments show that resonances can affect the stability of MEOs; these resonances are due to a third body (the Moon or the Sun) perturbation that becomes significant for medium and high altitudes. In this work we investigate the effect of the solar perturbation and of the resulting resonances, on the stability of high MEOs (semi-major axis greater than 20000 km). We build an Hamiltonian model suitable for a large class of resonances and use it to study analytically and numerically the stability around one particular resonance, affecting orbits close to the operational Galileo orbits. We focus in particular on the evolution of the eccentricity which is of fundamental importance to ensure that orbit crossings do not occur. An important conclusion is that for some initial conditions, the eccentricity can experience very large excursions (up to 0.8 for the considered resonance) making orbit crossings possible.},

abstract = {The problem of camera calibration is two-fold. On the one hand, the parameters are estimated from known correspondences between the captured image and the real world. On the other, these correspondences themselves—typically in the form of chessboard corners—need to be found. Many distinct approaches for this feature template extraction are available, often of large computational and/or implementational complexity. We exploit the generalized nature of deep learning networks to detect checkerboard corners: our proposed method is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large set of example chessboard images, which generalizes several existing solutions. The network is trained explicitly against noisy inputs, as well as inputs with large degrees of lens distortion. The trained network that we evaluate is as accurate as existing techniques while offering improved execution time and increased adaptability to specific situations with little effort. The proposed method is not only robust against the types of degradation present in the training set (lens distortions, and large amounts of sensor noise), but also to perspective deformations, e.g., resulting from multi-camera set-ups.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Basel.The spherical harmonic expressions of the horizontal sub-crustal stress components induced by the mantle convection are convergent only to low degrees. In this paper, we use the method of stress (S) function with numerical differentiation and present a formula for determining the degree of convergence from the mean Moho depth. We found that for the global mean Moho depth, 23 km, this convergence degree is 622 and for Iran, 35 km, it is 372. Also, three methods are developed and applied for computing the sub-crustal stress, (1) direct integration with a spectral kernel limited up to the degree of convergence, (2) integral inversion with a kernel having closed-form formula without any frequency limit, and (3) solving an integral equation with limited spectral kernel to the convergence degree. The second method has no divergence problem and its kernel function is well behaving so that the system of equations from which the S function is determined is stable, and no regularisation is needed to solve it. It should be noted that for using this method the resolution of the recovery should be higher than 0.5° × 0.5°, otherwise the recovered S function and correspondingly the stress components will have smaller magnitude than those derived from the other two methods. Our numerical studies for stress recovery in Iran and its surrounding areas show that the methods, which use the limited spectral kernels to the convergence degree, deliver consistent results to that of the spherical harmonic expansion.},

@article{Allende-Alba2016,
abstract = {Recent experience with prominent formation flying missions in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), such as GRACE and TanDEM-X, has shown the feasibility of precise relative navigation at millimeter and sub-millimeter levels using GPS carrier phase measurements with fixed integer ambiguities. However, the robustness and availability of the solutions provided by current algorithms may be highly dependent on the mission profile. The main challenges faced in the LEO scenario are the resulting short continuous carrier phase tracking arcs along with the observed rapidly changing ionospheric conditions, which in the particular situation of long baselines increase the difficulty of correct integer ambiguity resolution. To reduce the impact of these factors, the present study proposes a strategy based on a reduced-dynamics filtering of dual-frequency GPS measurements for precise baseline determination along with a dedicated scheme for integer ambiguity resolution, consisting of a hybrid sequential/batch algorithm based on the maximum a posteriori and integer aperture estimators. The algorithms have been tested using flight data from the GRACE, TanDEM-X and Swarm missions in order to assess their robustness to different formation and baseline configurations. Results with the GRACE mission show an average 0.7 mm consistency with the K/Ka-band ranging measurements over a period of more than two years in a baseline configuration of 220 km. Results with TanDEM-X data show an average of 3.8 mm consistency of kinematic and reduced-dynamic solutions in the along-track component over a period of 40 days in baseline configurations of 500 m and 75 km. Data from Swarm A and Swarm C spacecraft are largely affected by atmospheric scintillation and contain half cycle ambiguities. The results obtained under such conditions show an overall consistency between kinematic and reduced-dynamic solutions of 1.7 cm in the along-track component over a period of 30 days in a variable baseline of approximately 60–175 km. An analysis of one orbital period excluding a region where errors due to atmospheric scintillation occur, shows a consistency between kinematic and reduced-dynamic solutions of 3 mm in the along-track direction.},

abstract = {This paper describes the latest version of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model. IRI-2012 includes new models for the electron density and ion densities in the region below the F-peak, a storm-time model for the auroral E-region, an improved electron temperature model that includes variations with solar activity, and for the first time a description of auroral boundaries. In addition, the thermosphere model required for baseline neutral densities and temperatures was upgraded from MSIS-86 to the newer NRLMSIS-00 model and Corrected Geomagnetic coordinates (CGM) were included in IRI as an additional coordinate system for a better representation of auroral and polar latitudes. Ongoing IRI activities towards the inclusion of an improved model for the F2 peak height hmF2 are discussed as are efforts to develop a "Real-Time IRI". The paper is based on an IRI status report presented at the 2013 IRI Workshop in Olsztyn, Poland. The IRI homepage is at IRImodel.org.},

@article{Ray2003,
abstract = {The high precision gravity measurements to be made by recently launched (and recently approved) satellites place new demands on models of Earth, atmospheric, and oceanic tides. The latter is the most problematic. The ocean tides induce variations in the Earth's geoid by amounts that far exceed the new satellite sensitivities, and tidal models must be used to correct for this. Two methods are used here to determine the standard errors in current ocean tide models. At long wavelengths these errors exceed the sensitivity of the GRACE mission. Tidal errors will not prevent the new satellite missions from improving our knowledge of the geopotential by orders of magnitude, but the errors may well contaminate GRACE estimates of temporal variations in gravity. Solar tides are especially problematic because of their long alias periods. The satellite data may be used to improve tidal models once a sufficiently long time series is obtained. Improvements in the long-wavelength components of lunar tides are especially promising.},

The observations showed that the gravity typically (1) decreases coseismically, (2) continues to decrease for a few months, and (3) increases over a longer period. Therefore, postseismic gravity changes have two components with different time constants and polarities. Themechanisms of short- and long-term postseismic gravity changes are not as clear as coseismic changes at the moment, but might be explained to some extent with afterslip and the Maxwell viscoelasticity, respectively. These two components are difficult to discriminate with surface velocity measurements because the forearc area moves trenchward at both stages. They appear in different polarities in gravity, making satellite gravimetry a unique tool to separate them.},

abstract = {In the light of the three geoscientific satellite missions CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE the overall scientific aim is to achieve an automatism for the recovery of the Earth's gravity field respectively the physical shape of the Earth, namely the geoid. Furthermore, an improved understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of the geoid is of great benefit for the study of the dynamics of the Earth's lithosphere and upper mantle, global sea level variations, ocean circulation and ocean mass and heat transport, ice mass balance, the global water cycle and the interaction of these phenomena. This involves the determination of up to a hundred thousand unknown coefficients of the corresponding series expansion model from data sets which amount to several millions of observations provided by the satellites. The resulting system of equations which has to be solved for such an analysis cannot be evaluated without simplistic assumptions or within a satisfying time frame on personal computers due to hardware limitations. Consequently this challenging problem has to be tackled by means of high performance computing strategies. Only adoption of parallel programming standards such as MPI or OpenMP in conjunction with highly efficient numerical libraries allows for successfully accomplishing the demands of gravity field analysis. Indeed, the huge amount of data provided by satellite sensors, together with a high-resolution gravity field modeling, requires the determination of several ten thousands of unknown parameters and leads to the assignment that this problem is a true “challenge of calculus”.},

@article{Gu2007,
abstract = {Summary The dynamical equations for multiphase flow in porous media are highly nonlinear and the number of variables required to characterize the medium is usually large, often two or more variables per simulator gridblock. Neither the extended Kalman filter nor the ensemble Kalman filter is suitable for assimilating data or for characterizing uncertainty for this type of problem. Although the ensemble Kalman filter handles the nonlinear dynamics correctly during the forecast step, it sometimes fails badly in the analysis (or updating) of saturations. This paper focuses on the use of an iterative ensemble Kalman filter for data assimilation in nonlinear problems, especially of the type related to multiphase .ow in porous media. Two issues are key: (1) iteration to enforce constraints and (2) ensuring that the resulting ensemble is representative of the conditional pdf (i.e., that the uncertainty quantification is correct). The new algorithm is compared to the ensemble Kalman filter on several highly nonlinear example problems, and shown to be superior in the prediction of uncertainty. Introduction For linear problems, the Kalman filter is optimal for assimilating measurements to continuously update the estimate of state variables. Kalman filters have occasionally been applied to the problem of estimating values of petroleum reservoir variables (Eisenmann et al. 1994; Corser et al. 2000), but they are most appropriate when the problems are characterized by a small numb},

abstract = {Radio Occultation (RO) has been proven a powerful technique on profiling ionospheric electron density profile. The currently used Abel inversion in RO electron density profile retrieval has degraded performance in regions with large horizontal gradients because of an assumption of spherical symmetry as indicated by many studies. Due to the success of COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3, the Joint U.S.-Taiwan Executive Steering Committee has decided to move forward with a follow-on RO mission (called COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7), which implies that the number of RO observations will increase rapidly in the near future. It is thus worthwhile continuing retrieval method improvements. In this study, a global ionospheric data assimilation model is constructed. A series of simulation tasks are conducted to study the feasibility of RO electron density profile retrieval aided by a global ionospheric data assimilation model based on the planned COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 orbits and existing GPS, GLONASS and ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations configuration. We find that the data assimilation aided retrieval can significantly improve upon the Abel inversion and offers an optimal electron density profile retrieval approach if sufficient RO and ground GNSS observations are available. The retrieval error is affected by the data quantity, ionospheric variability, and accuracy of the data assimilation background. It is found that 700 globally distributed occultations per hour are sufficient to get better performance than the Abel inversion with the resolution of 2.5&deg; in latitude, 5&deg; in longitude, and 20 km in altitude in the data assimilation model.},

abstract = {Estimation of ocean circulation is investigated via assimilation of satellite measurements of the dynamic ocean topography (DOT) into the global finite-element ocean model (FEOM). The DOT was obtained by means of a geodetic approach from carefully cross-calibrated multi-mission altimeter data and GRACE gravity fields. The spectral consistency was achieved by consistently filtering both, the sea surface and the geoid. The filter length is determined by the spatial resolution of the gravity field and corresponds to approximately 241. km half width for the GRACE-based gravity field model ITG-Grace03s. The assimilation of the geodetic DOT was performed by employing a local singular evolutive interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter in combination with the method of weighting of observations. It is shown that this approach leads to a successful assimilation technique that reduced the RMS difference between the model and the data from 16. cm to 5. cm during one year of assimilation. The ocean model returns an optimized mean dynamic ocean topography. The effects of assimilation on transport estimates across several hydrographic World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) sections show improvements compared to the FEOM run without data assimilation. As a result of the assimilation, DOT estimates are available in the polar or coastal regions where the geodetic estimates from satellite data alone are not adequate. Furthermore, more realistic features of the ocean can be seen in these areas compared to those obtained using the filtered data fields. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Gaussian elimination is an efficient and numerically stable algorithm for estimating parameters and their precision. However, before estimating the parameters, it is often prudent to perform statistical tests to achieve the best fitting model. We use Gaussian elimination to select the best fitting model among candidate models. A succinct relationship between the weighted sum of squared residuals and the previous one is revealed by a volume formula. For quick parameter estimation and determination of weighted sum of squared residuals, a recursive elimination algorithm is proposed in the context of Gaussian elimination. In order to improve the model selection efficiency, the parameter estimation and the determination of the weighted sum of squared residuals are carried out in parallel using the pro- posed recursive elimination algorithm in which the improvement at each recursive stage is judged by the Bayesian information criterion. Ultimately, the computa- tional complexity and numerical stability of the recursive elimination proposed are briefly discussed, and a GNSS orbit interpolation example is used to verify the results. It shows that the proposed recursive elimination algorithm inherits the numerical stability of the Gaussian elimination, and this algorithm can be used to examine the gain from the newly introduced parameter, dynamically assess the fitting model, and fix the optimal model efficiently. The optimal fitting model with the lowest information is very close to the real situation verified by checkpoints.},

Klinkrad Technische 143 SEE Bent Hyperschall 39 SEE Available : Bent Retrieved : 16 ABSTRACT For satellites which are operated in low - Earth orbits (LEO) , gravitational forces due to the non - uniform mass distribution of the Earth are dominating the orbit and at - titude perturbation spectra . Non - gravitational forces are mainly caused by momentum exchange with the space - craft surface , and they are mostly of second order . The most prominent of these forces originate from the interac - tion of the spacecraft surface with molecules and ions of the thermosphere , and from the impact of photons which come directly from the sun , which are reflected as albedo from the illuminated Earth hemisphere , or which are re - emitted by the whole Earth as delayed infra - red (IR) re - radiation . In contrast with gravitational perturbations , the aerodynamic and radiation pressure effects are difficult to model since they require a good knowledge of the space - craft geometry and surface properties , and they also re - quire reliable estimates of the molecule and photon par - ticle flux . The necessary models of the thermosphere , and of the Earth albedo and IR re - radiation distributions are depending on a large set of parameters , including the spacecraft location , the time , the season (sun position) , and solar and geomagnetic activity levels . The variabil - ity of these environment models will be explained , and mathematical models will be described which allow to use the resulting molecule and photon flux models to com - pute perturbing forces and torques acting on a LEO satel - lite .

GRACE based water storage changes are compared with estimates from NASA's Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Results from the 22 GRACE monthly gravity solutions, covering the period April 2002 to July 2004, show remarkably good agreement with GLDAS in the Mississippi, Amazon, Ganges, Ob, Zambezi, and Victoria basins.

The approaches are tested using real GRACE data (November 5-25, 2002) and independently validated with Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) measurements over the same 21 days. Comparisons with the scientific orbits provided by GFZ indicate that the SD POD RMS accuracy can achieve 5, 10 and 6 cm in radial, along and cross the track, and the ZD POD RMS accuracy can achieve 4, 8 and 4 cm in radial, along and cross the track.

abstract = {Crustal movement is one of the main factors influencing the change of the Earth system, especially in its vertical direction, which affects people's daily life through the frequent occurrence of earthquakes, geological disasters, and so on. In order to get a better study and application of the vertical crustal movement,as well as its changes, the foundation and prerequisite areto devise and establish its reference frame; especially, a unified global reference frame is required. Since SLR (satellite laser ranging) is one of the most accurate space techniques for monitoring geocentric motion and can directly measure the ground station's geocentric coordinates and velocities relative to the centre of the Earth's mass, we proposed to take the vertical velocity of the SLR technique in the ITRF2008 framework as the reference frame of vertical crustal motion, which we defined as the SLR vertical reference frame (SVRF). The systematic bias between other velocity fields and the SVRF was resolved by using the GPS (Global Positioning System) and VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) velocity observations, and the unity of other velocity fields and SVRF was realized,as well. The results show that it is feasible and suitable to take the SVRF as a reference frame, which has both geophysical meanings and geodetic observations, so we recommend taking the SLR vertical velocity under ITRF2008 as the global reference frame of vertical crustal movement.},

It is anticipated that the gravity field induced orbit errors are reduced significantly when using these models in precise orbit computation of low flying satellites. The ERS-2 satellite is selected here to serve as an example for recomputation of its orbit using CHAMP- or GRACE-based gravity field models to test their accuracy using an external method. A data period is selected covering January 1996December 1998, including a large data set of Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), Precise Range and Range-rate Equipment (PRARE) and single- and dual-satellite (with TOPEX) altimeter crossover observations. The accuracy of the newly computed orbits is assessed by analyzing tracking data and altimeter crossover observation residuals, thereby giving an independent indication of the quality of the new gravity field models. It is indicated that using the best CHAMP- or GRACE-based gravity field models, a radial orbit accuracy improvement of a few cm is possible, which is consistent with the claimed accuracy level using the best pre-launch gravity field models.},

abstract = {Global high-resolution gravity models derived from ESA's GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) satellite mission have enabled a wealth of new applications in oceanography, geophysics and geodesy. Yet, it has been suspected for long that the traditional spherical harmonics (SHs) modelling fails to exploit the full information contained in the GOCE gradiometer measurements. Here, we demonstrate that a regional gravity retrieval strategy indeed performs favourable in a number of case studies and when compared with SH modelling, while applied to the same GOCE level 1b data. The regional strategy results in an up to a 50 per cent smaller noise level in smooth ocean areas and facilitates extracting additional signal in oceanic areas with high-frequency gravity field features. Our approach to regional gravity field determination from GOCE gradiometry employs a parametrization with radial basis functions, and it allows for regional tailoring of the regularization. This also enables us to assign more than one regularization area within a single regional solution, leading to an improved flexibility in dealing with the geographically varying roughness of the gravity field. We show that this results in a reduction of noise in areas of smooth gravity field and that it allows to extract additional information in regions with a strong high-frequency signal. Our regional solutions have been derived as refinements to the global GOCE-only model ITG-Goce02, and case studies have been carried out for the Pacific Ocean, in the area around the South Sandwich Trench in the southern Atlantic, and in the North Sea. Our results are validated against the global high-resolution gravity field model EGM2008 and against altimetry observations.},

abstract = {Current knowledge of the Earth's gravity field and its geoid, as derived from various observing techniques and sources, is incomplete. Within a reasonable time, substantial improvement can only come by exploiting new approaches based on satellite gravity observation methods. For this purpose three satellite missions will be realised, starting with CHAMP in 2000, followed by GRACE in 2002 and GOCE in 2004. Typical for all three missions is their extremely low and (almost) polar orbit, continuous and three-dimensional tracking by GPS and their ability to separate non-gravitational from gravitational signal parts. A further amplification of the gravity signal is achieved by inter-satellite tracking between two low orbiters in the case of GRACE and by gravity gradiometry in the case of GOCE. The rationale of GOCE will be discussed in more detail. The missions have a wide range of applications in solid Earth physics, oceanography, ice research, climatology, geodesy and sea level research.},

abstract = {At the 10th Thermospheric Ionospheric GEospheric Research (TIGER/COSPAR) symposium held in Moscow in 2014 the achievements from the start of TIGER in 1998 were summarized. During that period, great progress was made in measuring, understanding, and modeling the highly variable UV-Soft X-ray (XUV) solar spectral irradiance (SSI), and its effects on the upper atmosphere. However, after more than 50 years of work the radiometric accuracy of SSI observation is still an issue and requires further improvement. Based on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) data from the SOLAR/SolACES, and SDO/EVE instruments, we present a combined data set for the spectral range from 16.5 to 105.5 nm covering a period of 3.5 years from 2011 through mid of 2014. This data set is used in ionospheric modeling of the global Total Electron Content (TEC), and in validating EUV SSI modeling. For further investigations the period of 3.5 years is being extended to about 12 years by including data from SOHO/SEM and TIMED/SEE instruments. Similarly, UV data are used in modeling activities. After summarizing the results, concepts are proposed for future real-time SSI measurements with in-flight calibration as experienced with the ISS SOLAR payload, for the development of a space weather camera for observing and investigating space weather phenomena in real-time, and for providing data sets for SSI and climate modeling. Other planned topics are the investigation of the relationship between solar EUV/UV and visible/near-infrared emissions, the impact of X-rays on the upper atmosphere, the development of solar EUV/UV indices for different applications, and establishing a shared TIGER data system for EUV/UV SSI data distribution and real-time streaming, also taking into account the achievements of the FP7 SOLID (First European SOLar Irradiance Data Exploitation) project. For further progress it is imperative that coordinating activities in this special field of solar-terrestrial relations and solar physics is emphasized.},

Compared to the gravity signals of the continental hydrological cycle, local ocean mass variability reflecting ocean current, density and sea level changes are a challenge for the GRACE mission. Hence, validation of GRACE with in-situ observations of ocean bottom pressure is critical to evaluate the capability of GRACE to observe oceanic mass redistribution. Here, GRACE data is compared with in-situ ocean bottom pressure at a hundred sites located in all of the world's oceans. The advances made by recent GRACE product releases are shown, and gravity fields provided from different data centres are compared. In some regions, particularly at high-latitude sites with comparatively strong ocean bottom pressure variability and dense satellite coverage, GRACE captures oceanic variability quite well. This is a robust feature for all gravity field solutions. In contrast, some other regions show remarkably large differences between different GRACE solutions, suggesting that discrepancies in de-aliasing models play a major role in defining the skill of GRACE to realistically observe local oceanic mass variability.},

Our analysis reveals the following prominent features. First, the TEC response in tropical regions is strongly latitude dependent, with monotonic depletion at the dip equator but a semidiurnal perturbation at low latitudes. Second, the TEC semidiurnal perturbation possesses a significant hemispheric asymmetry in terms of onset date and magnitude. It starts on the same day as the SSW peak in the Northern Hemisphere but 2 days later in the Southern Hemisphere. Its magnitude is twice as strong in the north than in the south. Third, strong counter electrojet occurs in the afternoon, following the strengthening of the eastward EEJ in the morning. Fourth, semidiurnal perturbation in both TEC and EEJ possesses a phase shift, at a rate of about 0.7 h/day. Comparisons with results reported in the Peruvian sector reveal clear longitude dependence in the amplitude and hemispheric asymmetry of the semidiurnal perturbation. Finally, thermospheric density undergoes ∼25% decrease at low latitudes in the afternoon local time sector during the SSW, indicating significant cooling effects in the tropical upper thermosphere.

Firstly, we created and proved the single and combined analytical error models of the cumulative Venusian geoid height influenced by the gravity gradient error of the spacecraft-borne atom-interferometer gravity gradiometer (AIGG) and the orbital position error and orbital velocity error tracked by the deep space network (DSN) on the Earth station. Secondly, the ultra-high-precision spacecraft-borne AIGG is propitious to making a significant contribution to globally mapping the Venusian gravitational field and modeling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution through weighing the advantages and disadvantages among the electrostatically suspended gravity gradiometer, the superconducting gravity gradiometer and the AIGG. Finally, the future dedicated Venus-SGG spacecraft had better adopt the optimal matching accuracy indices consisting of 3×10-13 /s2 in gravity gradient, 10 m in orbital position and 8×10-4 m/s in orbital velocity and the preferred orbital parameters comprising an orbital altitude of 300±50 km, an observation time of 60 months and a sampling interval of 1 s.},

abstract = {In the event of a termination of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission before the launch of GRACE Follow-On (due for launch in 2017), high-low satellite-to-satellite tracking (hl-SST) will be the only dedicated observing system with global coverage available to measure the time-variable gravity field (TVG) on a monthly or even shorter time scale. Until recently, hl-SST TVG observations were of poor quality and hardly improved the performance of Satellite Laser Ranging observations. To date, they have been of only very limited usefulness to geophysical or environmental investigations. In this paper, we apply a thorough reprocessing strategy and a dedicated Kalman filter to Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) data to demonstrate that it is possible to derive the very long-wavelength TVG features down to spatial scales of approximately 2000 km at the annual frequency and for multi-year trends. The results are validated against GRACE data and surface height changes from long-term GPS ground stations in Greenland. We find that the quality of the CHAMP solutions is sufficient to derive long-term trends and annual amplitudes of mass change over Greenland. We conclude that hl-SST is a viable source of information for TVG and can serve to some extent to bridge a possible gap between the end-of-life of GRACE and the availability of GRACE Follow-On.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse {(GI)} modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The {GI} penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations {(SWEs).} To make representer computations efficient, the {SWEs} are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order {SWE} system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized {GI} penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the {SWE,} with soft momentum balance constraints (e.g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints. While the dynamical calculations involve elevations alone, depth-averaged currents can be directly assimilated into the tidal model with this approach. The efficient representer calculation forms the basis for the Oregon State University {(OSU)} Tidal Inversion Software {(OTIS).} {OTIS} includes software for generating grids, prior model covariances, and boundary conditions; for time stepping the nonlinear shallow water equations to generate a first guess or prior solution; for preliminary processing of {TOPEX/Poseidon} altimeter data; for solution of the {GI} problem; and for computation of posterior error bars. Approximate {GI} solution methods, based on using a reduced set of representers, allow very large datasets to be inverted. {OTIS} regional and local {GI} tidal modeling (with grids containing up to 105 nodes) require only a few hours on a common desktop workstation. Use of {OTIS} is illustrated by developing a new regional-scale (1/6{\^{A}}°) model of tides in the Indonesian Seas.},

@article{Rudenko2014,
abstract = {During the last decade a significant progress has been reached in the investigation of the gravity field of the Earth. Besides static, also time variable geopotential models have been recently created. In this paper we investigate the impact of the recent time variable geopotential models on altimetry satellite orbits and such altimetry products based on these orbits, as global and regional mean sea level trends. We show that the modeling of time variable gravity improves the orbit solutions, at least for the GRACE period where time variable gravity is sufficiently accurately observed by this mission. Our analysis includes six geopotential models jointly developed by GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and Space Geodesy Research Group (CNES/GRGS) Toulouse: the stationary model EIGEN-GL04S, a stationary version of EIGEN-6S (EIGEN-6S_stat), a corrected version of EIGEN-6S and three enhanced versions of EIGEN-6S called EIGEN-6S2, EIGEN-6S2A and EIGEN-6S2B. By ”stationary” we mean ”containing periodic parameters such as annual and semi-annual variations, but no secular (drift) terms”. We computed precise orbits for the radar altimetry satellites ERS-1, ERS-2, TOPEX/Poseidon, and Envisat over 20 years between 1991 and 2011. The orbit, single-mission and multi-mission altimetry crossover analyses show that the time variable models EIGEN-6S_corrected, EIGEN-6S2 and its two precursors EIGEN-6S2A/B perform notably better than the stationary models for the GRACE period from 2003 onwards. Thus, using EIGEN-6S2 and EIGEN-6S2A/B we have got 3.6% smaller root mean square fits of satellite laser ranging observations for Envisat, as when using EIGEN-GL04S. However, for the pre-GRACE period 1991 – 2003, the stationary geopotential models EIGEN-GL04S and EIGEN-6S_stat as well as EIGEN-6S2 having no drift terms for degree 3–50 at this time interval perform superior compared to EIGEN-6S_correct and EIGEN-6S2A/B which contain drifts for this period. We found, that the time variable geopotential models have a low (0.1-0.2 mm/yr) impact on our results for the global mean sea level trend. However, we found strong East/West differences up to 3 mm/yr in the regional mean sea level trends when using orbits of all four satellites based on time variable and stationary geopotential models. We show that these differences are related to the relative drifts of the centers-of-origin between the orbit solutions based on the time variable and stationary geopotential models. From the results of our detailed study, we conclude that the final version of the time variable gravity field model EIGEN-6S2 performs best for the four satellites tested. This model provides the most reliable and mission-consistent sea level estimates for the whole time period from 1992 to 2010. This model is of maximum spherical harmonic degree and order 260 and contains time series for drifts as well as annual and semiannual variations of the spherical harmonic coefficients for degree 2–50.},

abstract = {The GRACE mission has substantiated the low–low satellite-to-satellite tracking (LL-SST) concept. The LL-SST configuration can be combined with the previously realized high–low SST concept in the CHAMP mission to provide a much higher accuracy. The line of sight (LOS) acceleration difference between the GRACE satellite pair, the simplest form of the combined observable, is mostly used for mapping the global gravity field of the Earth in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients. As an alternative observable, a linear combination of the gravitational gradient tensor components is proposed. Being a one-point function and having a direct relation with the field geometry (curvature of the field at the point) are two noteworthy achievements of the alternative formulation. In addition, using an observation quantity that is related to the second-instead of the first-order derivatives of the gravitational potential amplifies the high-frequency part of the signal. Since the transition from the first- to the second-order derivatives includes the application of a finite-differences scheme, the high-frequency part of the noise is also amplified. Nevertheless, due to the different spectral behaviour of signal and noise, in the end the second-order approach leads to improved gravitational field resolution. Mathematical formulae for the gradiometry approach, for both linear and higher-degree approximations, are derived. The proposed approach is implemented for recovery of the global gravitational field and the results are compared with those of LOS acceleration differences. Moreover, LOS acceleration difference residuals are calculated, which are at the level of a few tenths of mGal. Error analysis shows that the residuals of the estimated degree variances are less than 10-3. Furthermore, the gravity anomaly residuals are less than 2 mGal for most points on the Earth.},

Comparable amounts of variance are also explained by AOD1B RL05 for colocated in situ ocean bottom pressure recorders. Although secular trends contained in AOD1B RL05 cause GRACE KBRR residuals to increase in shallow water regions, we find a reduction of those residuals over all open ocean areas, indicating that AOD1B RL05 is much better suited to remove nontidal high-frequency mass variability from satellite gravity observations than previous versions of AOD1B.},

abstract = {In recent years non-tidal Time Varying Gravity (TVG) has emerged as the most important contributor in the error budget of Precision Orbit Determination (POD) solutions for altimeter satellites' orbits. The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has provided POD analysts with static and time-varying gravity models that are very accurate over the 2002-2012 time interval, but whose linear rates cannot be safely extrapolated before and after the GRACE lifespan. One such model based on a combination of data from GRACE and Lageos from 2002-2010, is used in the dynamic POD solutions developed for the Geophysical Data Records (GDR) of the Jason series of altimeter missions and the equivalent products from lower altitude missions such as Envisat, Cryosat-2, and HY-2A. In order to accommodate long-term time-variable gravity variations not included in the background geopotential model, we assess the feasibility of using DORIS data to observe local mass variations using point mascons. In particular, we show that the point-mascon approach can stabilize the geographically correlated orbit errors which are of fundamental interest for the analysis of regional Mean Sea Level trends based on altimeter data, and can therefore provide an interim solution in the event of GRACE data loss. The time series of point-mass solutions for Greenland and Antarctica show good agreement with independent series derived from GRACE data, indicating a mass loss at rate of 210 Gt/year and 110 Gt/year respectively.},

abstract = {The joint ESA-NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission consists of a triangular formation of three satellites aiming at detecting gravitational waves. In linear approximation the LISA satellites describe a circle around a reference point, maintaining a fixed position with respect to each other. The reference point, the center of the triangle, orbits the Sun in a circular orbit, trailing the Earth at twenty degrees. In reality the distance between the satellites will vary by about one to two percent and the angle between the arms of the antenna will vary by about 0.5° over the course of one year for the nominal LISA satellite configuration. For measurement accuracy it is desirable that the pointing offset of the telescopes be kept small. This makes it necessary to actuate the telescopes or to control the formation. It was assumed that the LISA satellites are equipped with six $\mu$N engines that would allow to keep the two cubical proof masses within each satellite in almost perfect free fall. It was found that control forces up to about 700 $\mu$N are required for maintaining the absolute triangular LISA formation, leading to unacceptable excursions of the proof masses from free fall. However, these forces compensate predominantly very low frequency variations of the arm lengths and angles of the triangle, which are then to be compensated by the telescope actuators. The variations are outside the aimed LISA measurement bandwidth (10-4-0.1 Hz). In addition, the effect of thruster noise, orbit determination errors and orbit injection errors was examined. The effect of these error sources on the arm lengths and orientation angles between the LISA satellites was assessed both in open loop and in closed loop, where the closed loop was based on a proportional-derivative (PD) controller. It was found that orbit determination errors of the order of a few km in position and a few mm/s in velocity lead to negligible closed loop control forces. In addition, orbit injection errors of the order of 10 km in position and 1 cm/s in velocity could be eliminated after a few days when thrusting at levels of 200-500 $\mu$N. Even for a high estimated level of thruster noise below 10 -4 Hz (equivalent to about 2 $\mu$N random thrusts once an hour), the closed loop controller effectively reduced the effect on the angles of the triangle to below 30 nrad. {\textcopyright} 2007 COSPAR.},

abstract = {This study is based on 25 long time-series of tidal gravity observations\nrecorded with superconducting gravimeters at 20 stations belonging\nto the Global Geodynamic Project (GGP). We investigate the diurnal\nwaves around the liquid core resonance, i.e., K1, ??1 and ??1, to\ndetermine the free core nutation (FCN) period, and compare these\nexperimental results with models of the Earth response to the tidal\nforces. For this purpose, it is necessary to compute corrected amplitude\nfactors and phase differences by subtracting the ocean tide loading\n(OTL) effect. To determine this loading effect for each wave, it\nwas thus necessary to interpolate the contribution of the smaller\noceanic constituents from the four well determined diurnal waves,\ni.e., Q1, O1, P1, K1. It was done for 11 different ocean tide models:\nSCW80, CSR3.0, CSR4.0, FES95.2, FES99, FES02, TPXO2, ORI96, AG95,\nNAO99 and GOT00. The numerical results show that no model is decisively\nbetter than the others and that a mean tidal loading vector gives\nthe most stable solution for a study of the liquid core resonance.\nWe compared solutions based on the mean of the 11 ocean models to\nsubsets of six models used in a previous study and five more recent\nones. The calibration errors put a limit on the accuracy of our global\nresults at the level of ?�0.1%, although the tidal factors of O1\nand K1 are determined with an internal precision of close to 0.05%.\nThe results for O1 more closely fit the DDW99 non-hydrostatic anelastic\nmodel than the elastic one. However, the observed tidal factors of\nK1 and ??1 correspond to a shift of the observed resonance with respect\nto this model. The MAT01 model better fits this resonance shape.\nFrom our tidal gravity data set, we computed the FCN eigenperiod.\nOur best estimation is 429.7 sidereal days (SD), with a 95% confidence\ninterval of (427.3, 432.1). ?� Springer-Verlag 2006.},

In order to separate the dynamic part from the residual topography (that part of the Earth's topography which is not explained by the crustal model providing isostatic compensation) a correlation analysis is performed between the residual topography and long-wavelength isostatic gravity anomalies. It is found that the correlation between these quantities is positive for spatial wavelengths larger than 4000 kin. The resulting correlated part of residual topography is regarded to represent the dynamic topography. Its amplitude was estimated to range from -0.4 to 0.5 km and is on the lower limit of what was estimated from a direct modelling of mantle convection.

abstract = {2D Fourier series representation of a scalar field like gravitational potential is conventionally derived by making use of the Fourier series of the Legendre functions in the spherical harmonic representation. This representation has been employed so far only in the case of a scalar field or the functionals that are related to it through a radial derivative. This paper provides a unified scheme to represent any gravitational functional in terms of spherical coordinates using a 2D Fourier series representation. The 2D Fourier series representation for each individual point is derived by transforming the spherical harmonics from the geocentric Earth-fixed frame to a rotated frame so that its equator coincides with the local meridian plane of that point. In the obtained formulation, each functional is linked to the potential in the spectral domain using a spectral transfer. We provide the spectral transfers of the first-, second- and third-order gradients of the gravitational potential in the local north-oriented reference frame and also those of some functionals of frequent use in the physical geodesy. The obtained representation is verified numerically. Moreover, spherical harmonic analysis of anisotropic functionals and contribution analysis of the third-order gradient tensor are provided as two numerical examples to show the power of the formulation. In conclusion, the 2D Fourier series representation on the sphere is generalized to functionals of the potential. In addition, the set of the spectral transfers can be considered as a pocket guide that provides the spectral characteristics of the functionals. Therefore, it extends the so-called Meissl scheme.},

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Swarm is a European Space Agency (ESA) project that was launched on 22 November 2013, which consists of three Swarm satellites. Swarm precise orbits are essential to the success of the above project. This study investigates how well Swarm zero-differenced (ZD) reduced-dynamic orbit solutions can be determined using space-borne GPS data and optimized pseudo-stochastic pulses under high ionospheric activity. We choose Swarm space-borne GPS data from 1–25 October 2014, and Swarm reduced-dynamic orbits are obtained. Orbit quality is assessed by GPS phase observation residuals and compared with Precise Science Orbits (PSOs) released by ESA. Results show that pseudo-stochastic pulses with a time interval of 6 min and a priori standard deviation (STD) of 10−2 mm/s in radial (R), along-track (T) and cross-track (N) directions are optimized to Swarm ZD reduced-dynamic precise orbit determination (POD). During high ionospheric activity, the mean Root Mean Square (RMS) of Swarm GPS phase residuals is at 9–11 mm, Swarm orbit solutions are also compared with Swarm PSOs released by ESA and the accuracy of Swarm orbits can reach 2–4 cm in R, T and N directions. Independent Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) validation indicates that Swarm reduced-dynamic orbits have an accuracy of 2–4 cm. Swarm-B orbit quality is better than those of Swarm-A and Swarm-C. The Swarm orbits can be applied to the geomagnetic, geoelectric and gravity field recovery.},

Understanding whether this is a short-term shift or the beginning of a longer-term change in sea level has important impli-cations for coastal planning efforts in the coming decades. Here, we identify and quantify the recent shift in Pacific Ocean sea level, and also seek to describe the variability in a manner consistent with recent descrip-tions of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and particularly the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). More spe-cifically, we extract two dominant modes of sea level variability, one related to the biennial oscillation associated with ENSO and the other representative of lower-frequency variability with a strong signal in the northern Pacific. We rely on cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function (CSEOF) analysis along with sea level reconstructions to describe these modes and provide historical context for the recent sea level changes observed in the Pacific. As a result, we find that a shift in sea level has occurred in the Pacific Ocean over the past few years that will likely persist in the coming years, leading to substantially higher sea level off the west coast of the United States and lower sea level in the western tropical Pacific.},

abstract = {The restricted sensitivity of the GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) gradiometer instrument requires satellite gravity gradiometry to be supplemented by orbit analysis in order to resolve long-wavelength features of the geopotential. In this context, the energy conservation method gained particular interest to exploit GPS-based satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST) information. This method has been adopted within official ESA products. On the other hand, various investigations showed the energy conservation principle to be a sub-optimal choice. For this reason, we propose to estimate the low-frequency part of the gravity field by the acceleration approach, which proved to be an efficient and accurate tool in high-low-SST data analysis of former satellite data. This approach balances the gravitational vector with satellite accelerations by means of Newton's law of motion, and hence is characterized by (second-order) numerical differentiation of the kinematic orbit. However, the application of this method to GOCE-SST data, given with a 1s-sampling, showed that serious problems arise due to strong noise amplification of high frequency noise. In order to mitigate this problem, tailored processing strategies with regard to low-pass filtering, variance-covariance information handling, and robust parameter estimation have been adopted. By comparison of our GIWF (Geodetic Institute (GI), Space Research Institute (Institut f{\"{u}}r Weltraumforschung, IWF)) solutions and the official GOCE models with a state-of-the-art gravity field solution derived from GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment), we conclude that the acceleration approach is better suited for GOCE-only gravity field determination as opposed to the energy conservation method. Comparisons with solutions from other algorithms, e.g. the variational approach, show that the acceleration approach is able to estimate gravity fields of similar quality.},

abstract = {Better quantification of continental water storage variations is expected to improve our understanding of water flows, including evapotranspiration, runoff and river discharge as well as human water abstractions. For the first time, total water storage (TWS) on the land area of the globe as computed by the global water model WaterGAP (Water Global Assessment and Prognosis) was compared to both gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and global positioning system (GPS) observations. The GRACE satellites sense the effect of TWS on the dynamic gravity field of the Earth. GPS reference points are displaced due to crustal deformation caused by time-varying TWS. Unfortunately, the worldwide coverage of the GPS tracking network is irregular, while GRACE provides global coverage albeit with low spatial resolution. Detrended TWS time series were analyzed by determining scaling factors for mean annual amplitude (f<inf>GRACE</inf>) and time series of monthly TWS (f<inf>GPS</inf>). Both GRACE and GPS indicate that WaterGAP underestimates seasonal variations of TWS on most of the land area of the globe. In addition, seasonal maximum TWS occurs 1 month earlier according to WaterGAP than according to GRACE on most land areas. While WaterGAP TWS is sensitive to the applied climate input data, none of the two data sets result in a clearly better fit to the observations. Due to the low number of GPS sites, GPS observations are less useful for validating global hydrological models than GRACE observations, but they serve to support the validity of GRACE TWS as observational target for hydrological modeling. For unknown reasons, WaterGAP appears to fit better to GPS than to GRACE. Both GPS and GRACE data, however, are rather uncertain due to a number of reasons, in particular in dry regions. It is not possible to benefit from either GPS or GRACE observations to monitor and quantify human water abstractions if only detrended (seasonal) TWS variations are considered. Regarding GRACE, this is mainly caused by the attenuation of the TWS differences between water abstraction variants due to the filtering required for GRACE TWS. Regarding GPS, station density is too low. Only if water abstractions lead to long-term changes in TWS by depletion or restoration of water storage in groundwater or large surface water bodies, GRACE may be used to support the quantification of human water abstractions. &copy; 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Subtropical cyclones (STC) are low-pressure systems that share tropical and extratropical characteristics. Because of the great economic and social damage, the study of these systems has recently grown. This paper analyzes the cyclone formed in October 2014 near the Canary Islands and diagnoses such a cyclone in order to identify its correspondence to an STC category, examining its dynamical and thermal evolution. Diverse fields have been obtained from three different numerical models, and several diagnostic tools and cyclone phase space diagrams have been used. An extratropical cyclone, in its early stage, experimented a process of cut-off and isolation from the midlatitude flow. The incursion of a trough in conjunction with a low-level baroclinic zone favored the formation of the STC northwestern of the Canary Islands. Streamers of high potential vorticity linked to the cyclone favored strong winds and precipitation in the study domain. Cyclone phase space diagrams are used to complement the synoptic analysis and the satellite images of the cyclone to categorize such system. The diagrams reveal the transition from extratropical cyclone to STC remaining for several days with a subtropical structure with a quite broad action radius. The study of the mesoscale environment parameters showed an enhanced conditional instability through a deep troposphere layer. It is shown that moderate to strong vertical wind shear together with relatively warm sea surface temperature determine conditions enabling the development of long-lived convective structures.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) product used for this study consists of 43 monthly potential coefficient sets released by the GRACE science team which are used to generate surface mass thickness grids expressed as equivalent water heights (EQWHs). We optimized both the smoothing radius and the level of approximation by empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and found that 6.25� and three modes are able to describe more than 73.5% of the variance. The EQWHs obtained by the EOF method describe all known variations in the continental hydrology, present-day ice sheet melting, and global isostatic adjustment. To assess the quality of the estimated grids, we constructed degree error spectra of EQWHs. We conclude that a significant part of the errors in GRACE can be explained by a scaling factor of 0.85 relative to degree error estimates provided by the GGM02C gravity model but that the present-day errors in the GRACE data are a factor 2 to 5 larger than forecasted by tide model differences and atmospheric pressure differences. Comparison to a network of 59 International GNSS Service (IGS) stations confined the filter parameter settings to three EOF modes and 5 or 6.25� smoothing radius. Residuals that remain after the EOF method do exhibit S2 aliasing errors and a semiannual continental hydrology signal contained in the Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (GLDAS) model. Further analysis of the residual EOF signal revealed alternating track correlation patterns that are partially explained by the GRACE covariance matrix and the handling of nuisance parameters in the GRACE data processing.},

abstract = {We study the dynamics of the space debris in the 1:1 and 2:1 resonances, where geosynchronous and GPS satellites are located. By using Hamiltonian for-malism, we consider a model including the geopotential contribution for which we compute the secular and resonant expansions of the Hamiltonian. Within such model we are able to detect the equilibria and to study the main features of the resonances in a very effective way. In particular, we analyze the regular and chaotic behavior of the 1:1 and 2:1 resonant regions by analytical methods and by computing the Fast Lyapunov Indicators, which provide a cartography of the resonances. This approach allows us to detect easily the location of the equilibria, the amplitudes of the libration islands and the main dynamical stability features of the resonances, thus providing an overview of the 1:1 and 2:1 resonant domains under the effect of Earth's oblateness. The results are validated by a comparison with a model developed in Cartesian coor-dinates, including the geopotential, the gravitational attraction of Sun and Moon and the solar radiation pressure.},

@article{Mao2017,
abstract = {Precision Orbit Determination (POD) is a prerequisite for the success of many Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellite missions. With high-quality, dual-frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, typically precisions of the order of a few cm are possible for single-satellite POD, and of a few mm for relative POD of formation flying spacecraft with baselines up to hundreds of km. To achieve the best precision, the use of Phase Center Variation (PCV) maps is indispensable. For LEO GPS receivers, often a-priori PCV maps are obtained by a pre-launch ground campaign, which is not able to represent the real space-borne environment of satellites. Therefore, in-flight calibration of the GPS antenna is more widely conducted. This paper shows that a further improvement is possible by including the so-called Code Residual Variation (CRV) maps in absolute/undifferenced and relative/Double-differenced (DD) POD schemes. Orbit solutions are produced for the GRACE satellite formation for a four months test period (August-November, 2014), demonstrating enhanced orbit precision after first using the in-flight PCV maps and a further improvement after including the CRV maps. The application of antenna maps leads to a better consistency with independent Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and K-band Ranging (KBR) low-low Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (ll-SST) observations. The inclusion of the CRV maps results also in a much better consistency between reduced-dynamic and kinematic orbit solutions for especially the cross-track direction. The improvements are largest for GRACE-B, where a cross-talk between the GPS main antenna and the occultation antenna yields higher systematic observation residuals. For high-precision relative POD which necessitates DD carrier-phase ambiguity fixing, in principle frequency-dependent PCV maps would be required. To this aim, use is made of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that is capable of optimizing relative spacecraft dynamics and iteratively fixing the DD carrier-phase ambiguities. It is found that PCV maps significantly improve the baseline solution. CRV maps slightly enhance the baseline precision, more significantly they lead to a much better initialization of the ambiguity fixing. The GRACE single-satellite orbit solutions compare to within a few cm 3-dimensionally with state-of-the-art external orbit solutions and SLR observations, whereas for the baseline a consistency of better than 0.7 mm with KBR observations is achieved.},

The following gravitational and non-gravitational orbital disturbances are considered: the non-homogeneity of the lunar gravitational field; the gravitational attraction due to the third body, considering the Earth and the Sun; the lunar albedo; the solar radiation pressure. Numerical models were developed and implemented in an orbital trajectory simulator aiming to understand the dynamics of the orbital motion of an artificial satellite in lunar orbit when considering the simultaneous effect of all disturbances. Different orbits were simulated in order to characterize the major and the minor influence of each disturbing force as function of the inclination and the right ascension of the ascending node.

These estimates exhibit significant seasonal (30 ± 6 mm of equivalent water thickness) and long-term trends, the latter yielding a total loss of ∼280 km3 of water over the 50-month span of data. We also combine GRACE and precipitation data sets (CMAP, TRMM) to explore the relative contributions of the source term to the seasonal hydrological balance within the Congo Basin. We find that the seasonal water storage tends to saturate for anomalies greater than 30–40 mm of equivalent water thickness. Furthermore, precipitation contributed roughly three times the peak water storage after anomalously rainy seasons, in early 2003 and 2005, implying a ∼60–70% loss from runoff and evapotranspiration. Finally, a comparison of residual land water storage (monthly estimates minus best-fitting trends) in the Congo and Amazon Basins shows an anti-correlation, in agreement with the “see-saw” variability inferred by others from runoff data.},

abstract = {1 , M. R. van den Broeke 3 , J. T. M. Lenaerts 3 and I. Sasgen 4 The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been reported to be losing mass at accelerating rates 1,2 . If sustained, this accelerating mass loss will result in a global mean sea-level rise by the year 2100 that is approximately 43 cm greater than if a linear trend is assumed 2 . However, at present there is no scientific consensus on whether these reported accelerations result from variability inherent to the ice-sheet– climate system, or reflect long-term changes and thus permit extrapolation to the future 3 . Here we compare mass loss trends and accelerations in satellite data collected between January 2003 and September 2012 from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment to long-term mass balance time series from a regional surface mass balance model forced by re-analysis data. We find that the record length of spaceborne gravity observations is too short at present to meaningfully separate long-term accelerations from short-term ice sheet variability. We also find that the detection threshold of mass loss acceleration depends on record length: to detect an acceleration at an accuracy within ±10 Gt yr −2 , a period of 10 years or more of observations is required for Antarctica and about 20 years for Greenland. Therefore, climate variability adds uncertainty to extrapolations of future mass loss and sea-level rise, underscoring the need for continuous long-term satellite monitoring. Understanding and predicting recent and future sea-level rise (SLR) is a major challenge in present-day geophysical research. As the costs of adaptation scale nonlinearly with the rate of SLR (ref. 4), a cost-effective response by society requires accurate estimates of future SLR and, perhaps even more important for decision-making, the associated uncertainties. The ice sheets of Antarctica (AIS) and Greenland (GrIS) are expected to contribute to SLR in a warming climate 5 . Ice sheet mass balance may change through variations in surface mass balance (SMB: accumulation minus ablation at the surface) or through changes in the ice discharge from marine-terminating glaciers 6 . Owing to the inability of current ice sheet models to incorporate all processes governing ice loss—in particular the complex dynamical changes of the marginal glaciers 7 and the forcing at marine margins—the contribution of the GrIS and AIS to twenty-first-century SLR remains highly uncertain 3 . An alternative is to base near-future SLR projections on extrapolation of recent observed changes in the mass balance of the ice sheets, for example refs 2, 5,8,9. For example, Meier et al. 8 extrapolated observed trends and accelerations in ice sheet mass loss to provide an upper (continued acceleration) and lower (sustained trend only) range for future SLR. Recent studies point towards an increasing ice-mass loss of both ice sheets, raising the concern that earlier projections based on extrapolation of their observed present-day SLR contribution may underestimate future SLR. Based on data from the Gravity Recovery},

abstract = {Accurate estimate of the ice-sheet mass balance in Antarctic is very difficult due to complex ice sheet condition and sparse in situ measurements. In this paper, the low-degree gravity field coefficients of up to degree and order 5 derived from Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) measurements are used to determine the ice mass variations in Antarctica for the period 1993–2011. Results show that the ice mass is losing with -36±13 Gt/y in Antarctica, -42±11 Gt/y in the West Antarctica and 6±10 Gt/y in the East Antarctica from 1993 to 2011. The ice mass variations from the SLR 5×5 have a good agreement with the GRACE 5×5, GRACE 5×5 (1&2) and GRACE (60×60) for the entire continent since 2003, but degree 5 from SLR is not sufficient to quantify ice losses in West and East Antarctica, respectively. The rate of ice loss in Antarctica is -28±17 Gt/y for 1993-2002 and -55±17 Gt/y for 2003-2011, indicating significant accelerated ice mass losses since 2003. Furthermore, the results from SLR are comparable with GRACE measurements.},

@article{Tinin2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.In the geometrical optics approximation, the ionospheric part of error in measuring phase and code delays of the satellite signal may be represented as a rapidly decreasing series in inverse power of frequency. Such a simple frequency dependence allows us to use multi-frequency measurements for eliminating the error in such multi-frequency Global Navigation Satellite Systems as GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, and Galileo. However, the elimination of errors is handicapped by diffraction effects during signal propagation through turbulent ionospheric plasma. The numerical simulation has shown that when using the spatial processing in the form of Fresnel inversion the transition from dual-frequency to triple-frequency measurements reduces the average error of measurement. Yet fluctuations of the error diminish only if the inner scale exceeds the Fresnel radius. In the opposite case of excess of the Fresnel radius over the inner scale, the random component of the residual error is growing during the transition to triple-frequency measurements. The numerical simulation results also suggest that the Fresnel spatial processing in dual-frequency measurements at the optimal distance to the virtual screen can reduce the average error from centimeter to submillimeter level, which renders the transition to triple-frequency measurements unnecessary. The study of the residual error dependence on the distance from the virtual screen to the observer has revealed that the optimum value of this distance may be found from the minimum condition of amplitude scintillation index of the processed signal. The signal thus processed may be utilized both in geodetic precise measurements and in diagnostics of the lower atmosphere.},

abstract = {The paper presents the design and some simulated results of the attitude control of a two-satellite formation under study by the European Space Agency for the Next Generation Gravity Mission. The formation spacecrafts, with a distance between them of more than 200 km and orbiting around the Earth at about 300 km altitude, must align their axis to the satellite-to-satellite line with a microradian accuracy (pointing control). This is made possible by specific optical sensors accompanying the inter-satellite laser interferometer. Such sensors allow each satellite to autonomously align after an acquisition procedure. Pointing control is constrained by the angular drag-free control, which, imposed by Earth gravimetry, must zero the spacecraft angular acceleration vector below 0.01 microradian/s2 in the science bandwidth. This is made possible by ultrafine accelerometers of the GOCE-class, whose measurements must be coordinated with attitude sensors to meet drag-free and pointing requirements. Embedded Model Control shows how coordination can be implemented around the embedded model of the spacecraft attitude and of the formation frame quaternion. Evidence and discussion about some critical requirements is also included.},

@article{Dahle2017,
abstract = {The Swarm mission consists of three identical satellites equipped with GPS receivers and orbiting in near-polar low Earth orbits. Thus, they can be used to determine the Earth's gravity field by means of high-low satellite-to-satellite tracking (hl-SST). However, first results by several groups have revealed systematic errors both in precise science orbits and resulting gravity field solutions which are caused by ionospheric disturbances affecting the quality of Swarm GPS observations. Looking at gravity field solutions, the errors lead to systematic artefacts located in two bands north and south of the geomagnetic equator. In order to reduce these artefacts, erroneous GPS observations can be identified and rejected before orbit and gravity field processing, but this may also lead to slight degradations of orbit and low degree gravity field coefficient quality. Since the problems were believed to be receiver-specific, the GPS tracking loop bandwidths onboard Swarm have been widened several times starting in May 2015. The influence of these tracking loop updates on Swarm orbits and, particularly, gravity field solutions is investigated in this work. The main findings are that the first updates increasing the bandwidth from 0.25 Hz to 0.5 Hz help to significantly improve the quality of Swarm gravity fields and that the improvements are even larger than those achieved by GPS data rejection. It is also shown that these improvements are indeed due to an improved quality of GPS observations around the geomagnetic equator, and not due to missing observations in these regions. As the ionospheric activity is rather low in the most recent months, the effect of the tracking loop updates in summer 2016 cannot be properly assessed yet. Nevertheless, the quality of Swarm gravity field solutions has already improved after the first updates which is especially beneficial in view of filling the upcoming gap between the GRACE and GRACE Follow-on missions with hl-SST gravity products.},

abstract = {A method is defined for simultaneous atmospheric density calibration and satellite orbit determination for a satellite constellation, and a linearized observability analysis is performed to evaluate the feasibility of the approach. Such an estimation scheme will provide data-based estimates of upper atmosphere density that improve on existing models, e.g. the Jacchia models, along with enhanced accuracy of the associated satellites' orbits. A new spline-based atmospheric density parameterization is developed that meshes well with the structure of the orbit determination problem and can be initialized so as to match the outputs of a traditional model. While conceptually similar to previous atmospheric calibration efforts, the proposed constellation approach restricts its global density estimates to the relevant satellite altitude range and thus reduces the complexity of the estimation problem. Measurements include dual-one-way-ranging between pairs of adjacent satellites in the same orbital plane, and carrier phase and pseudorange measurements between ground stations and satellites. Equations for a linearized observability analysis are derived and shown to be equivalent to the covariance calculations of an extended square-root information filter. In addition to the system observability evaluation, the impact of incorporating some a priori density information is explored. The results show that atmospheric density can be observed, but a reasonable amount of a priori information is necessary to obtain useful estimates. Degree of observability depends on the constellation configuration and dynamic model parameter values.},

abstract = {The main objective of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Atmospheric and Oceanic De-Aliasing Level-1B product (AOD1B) is the removal of high-frequency non-tidal mass variations due to sub-monthly mass transport in the atmosphere and oceans. Application of AOD1B shall avoid aliasing of these high-frequency signals into monthly gravity models derived from modern gravity missions and shall help to derive consistent orbit solutions for altimetry and Satellite Laser Ranging missions. The AOD1B 6-h series of spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 100 are routinely generated at the German Research Centre for Geoscience and distributed to the GRACE Science Data System and the user community. Inputs for this product are acquired from numerical weather prediction models which are regularly revised and consequently not stable in time. The latest AOD1B release 5 (RL05) is based, as all other releases, on input from ECMWF and does not resolve this problem of discontinuities present in the surface pressure and surface geopotential input data. This might contaminate the gravity field variations derived from atmospheric mass variations. In this paper we present a method to overcome this problem during future AOD1B product generation, as well as two new Level-2 products (GAE and GAF) that, over land, fix a posteriori the two jumps present in the already distributed Level-2 RL05 monthly gravity models which were based on AOD1B RL05. The impact of the proposed correction on the variations and long-term trend of the total mass of the atmosphere and on the ice mass balance over Antarctica and over Greenland is also illustrated. We found that the GAE/GAF-corrected trend of the global atmospheric mass over the GRACE mission lifetime significantly decreased from -0.05 to -0.02 mm yr-1 in terms of geoid height. A considerable effect (33 per cent) was also found in the quadratic term of ice mass loss over Antarctica which results in an acceleration of 3.2 Gt yr-1 yr-1 smaller than without applying this correction.},

The problem of merging these solutions by spectral combination is the main subject of this paper. Integral estimators of biased- and unbiased-types are presented for recovering the disturbing gravity potential from gravity gradients. It is shown that only kernels of the biased-type integral estimators are suitable for simultaneous downward continuation and combination of gravity gradients. Numerical results show insignificant practical difference between the biased and unbiased estimators at sea level and the contribution of far-zone gravity gradients remains significant for integration. These contributions depend on the noise level of the gravity gradients at higher levels than sea. In the cases of combining the gravity gradients, contaminated with Gaussian noise, at sea and 250 km levels the errors of the estimated geoid heights are about 10 and 3 times smaller than those obtained by each integral. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Basel AG.},

abstract = {Catalog maintenance for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) demands an accurate and computationally lean orbit propagation and orbit determination technique to cope with the ever increasing number of observed space objects. As an alternative to established numerical and analytical methods, we investigate the accuracy and computational load of the Draper Semi-analytical Satellite Theory (DSST). The Standalone version of the DSST was enhanced with additional perturbation models to improve its recovery of short periodic motion. The accuracy of DSST is, for the first time, compared to a numerical propagator with fidelity force models for a comprehensive grid of low, medium, and high altitude orbits with varying eccentricity and different inclinations. Furthermore, the run-time of both propagators is compared as a function of propagation arc, output step size and gravity field order to assess its performance for a full range of relevant use cases. For use in orbit determination, a robust performance of DSST is demonstrated even in the case of sparse observations, which is most sensitive to mismodeled short periodic perturbations. Overall, DSST is shown to exhibit adequate accuracy at favorable computational speed for the full set of orbits that need to be considered in space surveillance. Along with the inherent benefits of a semi-analytical orbit representation, DSST provides an attractive alternative to the more common numerical orbit propagation techniques.},

We have therefore analyzed long time series of DORIS range-rate residuals in order to investigate possible systematic errors common to all DORIS analysis strategies and software packages, either on a satellite or on a station basis. In particular, the investigation has focused on global DORIS data of six satellites (TOPEX, Jason, Envisat and SPOT-2, -4 and -5) and station-specific data for Fairbanks, Easter Island and Syowa Base. Large measurement errors when crossing the South Atlantic Anomaly are easily detected in the DORIS residuals of Jason, while Envisat residuals show the most prominent evidence of multipath interference and the effect of a flight software update. Particularly, large errors were also found in low-elevation data. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Radio occultation (RO) is a powerful technique for providing vertical profiles of refractivity, temperature, pressure, and water vapor of the neutral atmosphere and electron density of the ionosphere. The Abel inversion method which is based on the spherical symmetry assumption has been widely utilized to retrieve electron density profiles (EDPs) from RO measurements, which are available by observing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites from low-earth-orbit satellites. It is well known that the Abel inversion is subject to errors in the presence of ionospheric horizontal gradients. With the arrival of new navigation systems, the opportunities of establishing simultaneous GNSS RO events are increasing. We develop an improved Abel inversion technique that accounts for pairs of simultaneous RO events to relax the spherical symmetry assumption. Through the use of Tikhonov regularization, the problem is formulated so that numerical conditioning is improved and a priori information such as expected electron density, asymmetric factor, and vertical total electron content can be incorporated. Appropriate weighting can be determined to reflect the availability and quality of information. By balancing the reference data and measurements, the method thus paves a way for ionospheric probing in challenging geomagnetic conditions as both the EDP at the intersection and the horizontal gradients are retrieved. Simulation and experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The robustness and sensitivity of the proposed method are also assessed.},

abstract = {Sidereal filtering is a technique used to reduce errors caused by multipath in the positioning of static receivers via the Global Positioning System (GPS). It relies upon the receiver and its surrounding environment remaining static from one day to the next and takes advantage of the approximately sidereal repeat time of the GPS constellation geometry. The repeating multipath error can thus be identified, usually in the position domain, and largely removed from the following day. We describe an observation-domain sidereal filter algorithm that operates on undifferenced ionospheric-free GPS carrier phase measurements to reduce errors caused by multipath. It is applied in the context of high-rate (1 Hz) precise point positioning of a static receiver. An observation-domain sidereal filter (ODSF) is able to account for the slightly different repeat times of each GPS satellite, unlike a position-domain sidereal filter (PDSF), and can hence be more effective at reducing high-frequency multipath error. Using 8-h long datasets of GPS measurements from two different receivers with different antenna types and contrasting environments, the ODSF algorithm is shown overall to yield a position time series 5–10 % more stable, in terms of Allan deviation, than a PDSF over nearly all time intervals below about 200 s in length. This may be particularly useful for earthquake and tsunami early warning systems where the accurate measurement of small displacements of the ground over the period of just a few minutes is crucial. However, the sidereal filters are also applied to a third dataset during which two short episodes of particularly high-frequency multipath error were identified. These two periods are analyzed in detail and illustrate the limitations of using sidereal filters with important implications for other methods of correcting for multipath at the observation level.},

abstract = {Precise relative orbit determination is an essential element for the generation of science products from distributed instrumentation of formation flying satellites in low Earth orbit. According to the mission profile, the required formation is typically maintained and/or controlled by executing maneuvers. In order to generate consistent and precise orbit products, a strategy for maneuver handling is mandatory in order to avoid discontinuities or precision degradation before, after and during maneuver execution. Precise orbit determination offers the possibility of maneuver estimation in an adjustment of single-satellite trajectories using GPS measurements. However, a consistent formulation of a precise relative orbit determination scheme requires the implementation of a maneuver estimation strategy which can be used, in addition, to improve the precision of maneuver estimates by drawing upon the use of differential GPS measurements. The present study introduces a method for precise relative orbit determination based on a reduced-dynamic batch processing of differential GPS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements, which includes maneuver estimation as part of the relative orbit adjustment. The proposed method has been validated using flight data from space missions with different rates of maneuvering activity, including the GRACE, TanDEM-X and PRISMA missions. The results show the feasibility of obtaining precise relative orbits without degradation in the vicinity of maneuvers as well as improved maneuver estimates that can be used for better maneuver planning in flight dynamics operations.},

abstract = {Time series of regional 2° × 2° Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) solutions of surface water mass change have been computed over Africa from 2003 to 2012 with a 10-day resolution by using a new regional approach. These regional maps are used to describe and quantify water mass change. The contribution of African hydrology to actual sea level rise is negative and small in magnitude (i.e., −0.1 mm/y of equivalent sea level (ESL)) mainly explained by the water retained in the Zambezi River basin. Analysis of the regional water mass maps is used to distinguish different zones of important water mass variations, with the exception of the dominant seasonal cycle of the African monsoon in the Sahel and Central Africa. The analysis of the regional solutions reveals the accumulation in the Okavango swamp and South Niger. It confirms the continuous depletion of water in the North Sahara aquifer at the rate of −2.3 km3/y, with a decrease in early 2008. Synergistic use of altimetry-based lake water volume with total water storage (TWS) from GRACE permits a continuous monitoring of sub-surface water storage for large lake drainage areas. These different applications demonstrate the potential of the GRACE mission for the management of water resources at the regional scale.},

Then, the attainable target areas from a given position on the initial elliptic orbit, the feasible impulse position for approaching to a given point in space and the optimal approaching orbit to a given point are analyzed. Based on the optimal approaching orbit, the optimal solution for target flyby is provided in the time free case, and a suboptimal solution for the case of time-constrained.

This paper deals with the analytic derivation of the Doppler shift measured by a user on the surface of Earth on a signal transmitted by a circular orbit LEO satellite. Two simplifications are performed to obtain the analytical expression of the Doppler shift as a function of time. First, during the visibility duration of the satellite at a terminal, the trajectory of the satellite with respect to the Earth is approximated by a great circle arc. Second, the angular velocity of the satellite with respect to the user is assumed to be constant. Numerical results validate the approximations. Another result of our analysis is an expression for the visibility window duration of a satellite at a terminal as a function of the maximum elevation angle. An algorithm for estimating the parameters of the Doppler curve based on a couple of Doppler and Doppler-rate measurements is also presented},

abstract = {The Earth's non-spherical mass distribution and atmospheric drag cause the strongest perturbations on very low-Earth orbiting satellites (LEOs).Models of gravitational and non-gravitational accelerations are utilized in dynamic precise orbit determination (POD) with GPS data, but it is also possible to derive LEO positions based on GPS precise point positioning without dynamical information. We use the reduced-dynamic technique for LEO POD, which combines the geometric strength of the GPS observations with the force models, and investigate the performance of different pseudo-stochastic orbit parametrizations, such as instantaneous velocity changes (pulses), piecewise constant accelerations, and continuous piecewise linear accelerations. The estimation of such empirical orbit parameters in a stan- dard least-squares adjustment process of GPS observations, together with other relevant parameters, strives for the highest precision in the computation of LEO trajectories. We used the procedures for the CHAMP satellite and found that the orbits may be validated by means of independent SLR measurements at the level of 3.2cm RMS. Validations with independent accelerometer data revealed correlations at the level of 95% in the along-track direction. As expected, the empir- ical parameters compensate to a certain extent for deficiencies in the dynamic models. We analyzed the capability of pseudo-stochastic parameters for deriving information about themismodeled part of the forcefield and found evidence that the resulting orbits may be used to recover force field parameters, if the number of pseudo-stochastic parameters is large enough. Results based on simulations showed a significantly better performance of acceleration-based orbits for gravity field recovery than for pulse-based orbits,with a quality comparable to a direct estimation if unconstrained accelerations are set up every 30s.},

It was held 31 August to 4 September 2009 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The theme "Geodesy for Planet Earth" was selected to follow the International Year of Planet Earth 2007-2009 goals of utilizing the knowledge of the world's geoscientists to improve society for current and future generations. The International Year started in January 2007 and ran thru 2009 which coincided with the IAG2009 Scientific Assembly, one of the largest and most significant meetings of the Geodesy community held every 4 years. The IAG2009 Scientific Assembly was organized into eight Sessions. Four of the Sessions of IAG2009 were based on the IAG Structure (i.e. one per Commission) and covered Reference Frames, Gravity Field, Earth Rotation and Geodynamics, and Positioning and Applications. Since IAG2009 was taking place in the great Argentine city of Buenos Aires, a Session was devoted to the Geodesy of Latin America. A Session dedicated to the IAG's Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS), the primary observing system focused on the multidisciplinary research being done in Geodesy that contributes to important societal issues such as monitoring global climate change and the environment. A Session on the IAG Services was also part of the Assembly detailing the important role they play in providing geodetic data, products, and analysis to the scientific community. A final Session devoted to the organizations ION, FIG, and ISPRS and their significant work in navigation and earth observation that complements the IAG.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived gravity solutions contain errors mostly due to instrument noise, anisotropic spatial sampling, and temporal aliasing. Improving the quality of satellite gravimetry observations, in terms of using more sensitive sensors and/or increasing the spatial isotropy, has been discussed in the context of the designed scenarios of future satellite gravimetry missions. Temporal aliasing caused by incomplete reducing of background models, however, is still a factor that affects the quality of the gravity field solutions. This paper specifically explores the possible physical, geometrical, and numerical modifications of the three‒dimensional (3‒D) integration approach to eliminate the high‒frequency atmospheric effects from satellite gravimetry observations. The new modified 3‒D approach is then applied to compute new sets of atmospheric dealiasing products, using atmospheric fields from the European Centre for Medium‒Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational analysis model and ERA‒Interim reanalysis. Impacts of modifications are compared to the prelaunch baseline and the current error‒curve of GRACE as well as an error‒curve of a Bender‒type multiorbit satellite configuration. Specifically, we found that using latitude‒dependent radius, latitude‒ and altitude‒dependent gravity accelerations along with numerical modifications have a considerable impact on the 3‒D integral. Comparing the new products to those of GRACE Atmosphere and Ocean Dealiasing level‒1B shows a nonnegligible difference with respect to the prelaunch baseline of GRACE and a possible Bender‒type mission up to harmonic degrees 13 and 50, respectively. A big difference is also found between the derived dealiasing products from ECMWF operational analysis and ERA‒Interim indicating the importance of input parameters on the final atmospheric dealiasing products.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), along with other relevant field and remote sensing datasets, was used to assess the performance of two land surface models (LSMs: CLM4.5-SP and GLDAS-Noah) over the African continent and improve the outputs of the CLM4.5-SP model. Spatial and temporal analysis of monthly (January 2003–December 2010) Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) estimates extracted from GRACE (TWSGRACE), CLM4.5-SP (TWSCLM4.5), and GLDAS-Noah (TWSGLDAS) indicates the following: (1) compared to GRACE, LSMs overestimate TWS in winter months and underestimate them in summer months; (2) the amplitude of annual cycle (AAC) of TWSGRACE is higher than that of TWSLSM (AAC: TWSGRACE > TWSGLDAS > TWSCLM4.5); (3) higher, and statistically significant correlations were observed between TWSGRACE and TWSGLDAS compared to those between TWSGRACE and TWSCLM4.5; (4) differences in forcing precipitation and temperature datasets for GLDAS-Noah and CLM4.5-SP models are unlikely to be the main cause for the observed discrepancies between TWSGRACE and TWSLSM; and (5) the CLM4.5-SP model overestimates evapotranspiration (ET) values in summer months and underestimates them in winter months compared to ET estimates extracted from field-based (FLUXNET-MTE) and satellite-based (MOD16 and GLEAM) ET measurements. A first-order correction was developed and applied to correct the CLM4.5-derived ET, soil moisture, groundwater, and TWS. The corrections improved the correspondence (i.e., higher correlation and comparable AAC) between TWSCLM4.5 and TWSGRACE over various climatic settings. Our findings suggest that similar straightforward correction approaches could potentially be developed and used to assess and improve the performance of a wide range of LSMs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.We propose a method that uses only one set of known orbital elements to directly determine the motion state and variation ranges of motion parameters, including the inclination, right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN), evolution period of the orbital plane, maximum libration amplitude of the semi-major axis, commensurable angle, libration period and drift period, for space debris in the geosynchronous ring. These variation ranges of motion parameters characterize the evolution of debris quantitatively and illustrate the three-dimensional (3D) variations. Employing the proposed method, we study the motion state and variation ranges of motion parameters for catalogued and uncontrolled space debris with existing two-line element (TLE) data in the geosynchronous ring, and present specific results. We also compare our results with actual observational results derived from long-term TLE historical data, and find that, in the vast majority of cases, our proposed method of determining the motion state and variation ranges of motion parameters via only one set of known orbital elements is effective. In addition, before the elaboration of the variation ranges of motion parameters stated above, we obtain the statistical distribution of space debris in the orbital plane and the daily motion from the TLE historical data. We then derive two mathematical formulae that explain the statistical distribution and daily motion on the basis of the essence of dynamics, which contributes to the characterization of the evolution of debris.},

@article{Lv2017,
abstract = {The application of real-time precise point positioning (PPP) requires real-time precise orbit and clock products that should be predicted within a short time to compensate for the communication delay or data gap. Unlike orbit correction, clock correction is difficult to model and predict. The widely used linear model hardly fits long periodic trends with a small data set and exhibits significant accuracy degradation in real-time prediction when a large data set is used. This study proposes a new prediction model for maintaining short-term satellite clocks to meet the high-precision requirements of real-time clocks and provide clock extrapolation without interrupting the real-time data stream. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to analyze the linear prediction residuals of real-time clocks. The periodic terms obtained through FFT are adopted in the sliding window prediction to achieve a significant improvement in short-term prediction accuracy. This study also analyzes and compares the accuracy of short-term forecasts (less than 3 h) by using different length observations. Experimental results obtained from International GNSS Service (IGS) final products and our own real-time clocks show that the 3-h prediction accuracy is better than 0.85 ns. The new model can replace IGS ultra-rapid products in the application of real-time PPP. It is also found that there is a positive correlation between the prediction accuracy and the short-term stability of on-board clocks. Compared with the accuracy of the traditional linear model, the accuracy of the static PPP using the new model of the 2-h prediction clock in N, E, and U directions is improved by about 50%. Furthermore, the static PPP accuracy of 2-h clock products is better than 0.1 m. When an interruption occurs in the real-time model, the accuracy of the kinematic PPP solution using 1-h clock prediction product is better than 0.2 m, without significant accuracy degradation. This model is of practical significance because it solves the problems of interruption and delay in data broadcast in real-time clock estimation and can meet the requirements of real-time PPP.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the effects of horizontal refractivity gradients on the propagation of optical signals for a globally distributed set of Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) stations. Using two-dimensional ray tracing and globally distributed satellite data from NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), as well atmospheric fields from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), we calculate the effects of horizontal gradients on a global set of SLR stations using 2 years of data during 2004 and 2005. We investigate in detail how seasonal and diurnal changes, latitudinal dependence, topography, and oceans affect the gradients at specific locations, as well as the application of these gradients on a set of SLR data from the LAGEOS 1 and 2 geodetic satellites. For the year 2004, AIRS ray-tracing results showed maximum north-south (NS) gradient delays of 50 mm at 10 degrees elevation angle at Herstmonceux, UK and east-west (EW) gradient delays of 35 mm at Yarragadee, Australia. Mean NS and EW gradients had delays not exceeding 5 mm for both AIRS and NCEP analysis at all stations. The standard deviations of AIRS gradients ranged from 6 to 12 mm, while NCEP gradients ranged from 3 to 9 mm, depending on location and time of year. The effects of applying AIRS and NCEP total ray-tracing results, including horizontal gradient contributions, to a set of global SLR geodetic data resulted in reduction of the solution residuals by up to 43% in variance percent difference. This is a highly significant contribution for the SLR technique's effort to reach an accuracy at the 1-mm level this decade.},

abstract = {Present-day continental mass variation as observed by space gravimetry reveals secular mass decline and accumulation. Whereas the former contributes to sea-level rise, the latter results in sea-level fall. As such, consideration of mass accumulation (rather than focussing solely on mass loss) is important for reliable overall estimates of sea-level change. Using data from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment satellite mission, we quantify mass-change trends in 19 continental areas that exhibit a dominant signal. The integrated mass change within these regions is representative of the variation over the whole land areas. During the integer 9-year period of May 2002 to April 2011, GIA-adjusted mass gain and mass loss in these areas contributed, on average, to −(0.7 ± 0.4) mm/year of sea-level fall and + (1.8 ± 0.2) mm/year of sea-level rise; the net effect was + (1.1 ± 0.6) mm/year. Ice melting over Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, the Canadian Arctic archipelago, Antarctica, Alaska and Patagonia was responsible for + (1.4±0.2) mm/year of the total balance. Hence, land-water mass accumulation compensated about 20 % of the impact of ice-melt water influx to the oceans. In order to assess the impact of geocentre motion, we converted geocentre coordinates derived from satellite laser ranging (SLR) to degree-one geopotential coefficients. We found geocentre motion to introduce small biases to mass-change and sea-level change estimates; its overall effect is + (0.1 ± 0.1) mm/year. This value, however, should be taken with care owing to questionable reliability of secular trends in SLR-derived geocentre coordinates.},

abstract = {Antarctic volume changes during the past 21 thousand years are smaller than previously thought, and here we construct an ice sheet history that drives a forward model prediction of the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) gravity signal. The new model, in turn, should give predictions that are constrained with recent uplift data. The impact of the GIA signal on a Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Antarctic mass balance estimate depends on the specific GRACE analysis method used. For the method described in this paper, the GIA contribution to the apparent surface mass change is re-evaluated to be +55±13 Gt/yr by considering a revised ice history model and a parameter search for vertical motion predictions that best fit the GPS observations at 18 high-quality stations. Although the GIA model spans a range of possible Earth rheological structure values, the data are not yet sufficient for solving for a preferred value of upper and lower mantle viscosity nor for a preferred lithospheric thickness. GRACE monthly solutions from the Center for Space Research Release 04 (CSR-RL04) release time series from January 2003 to the beginning of January 2012, uncorrected for GIA, yield an ice mass rate of +2.9± 29 Gt/yr. The new GIA correction increases the solved-for ice mass imbalance of Antarctica to −57±34 Gt/yr. The revised GIA correction is smaller than past GRACE estimates by about 50 to 90 Gt/yr. The new upper bound to the sea level rise from the Antarctic ice sheet, averaged over the time span 2003.0–2012.0, is about 0.16±0.09 mm/yr.},

abstract = {During the middle and late Eocene (∼48–34Myr ago), the Earth's climate cooled1,2 and an ice sheet built up on Antarctica. The stepwise expansion of ice on Antarctica3,4 induced crustal deformation and gravitational perturbations around the continent. Close to the ice sheet, sea level rose5,6 despite an overall reduction in the mass of the ocean caused by the transfer of water to the ice sheet. Here we identify the crustal response to ice-sheet growth by forcing a glacial-hydro isostatic adjustment model7 with an Antarctic ice-sheet model. We find that the shelf areas around East Antarctica first shoaled as upper mantle material upwelled and a peripheral forebulge developed. The inner shelf subsequently subsided as lithosphere flexure extended outwards from the ice-sheet margins. Consequently the coasts experienced a progressive relative sea-level rise. Our analysis of sediment cores from the vicinity of the Antarctic ice sheet are in agreement with the spatial patterns of relative sea-level change indicated by our simulations. Our results are consistent with the suggestion8 that near-field processes such as local sea-level change influence the equilibrium state obtained by an ice- sheet grounding line. Antarctic},

abstract = {We analyse data from seven superconducting gravimeter (SG) stations in Europe from 2002 to 2007 from the Global Geodynamics Project (GGP) and compare seasonal variations with data from GRACE and several global hydrological models—GLDAS, WGHM and ERA-Interim. Our technique is empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition of the fields that allows for the inherent incompatibility of length scales between ground and satellite observations. GGP stations below the ground surface pose a problem because part of the attraction from soil moisture comes from above the gravimeter, and this gives rise to a complex (mixed) gravity response. The first principle component (PC) of the EOF decomposition is the main indicator for comparing the fields, although for some of the series it accounts for only about 50 per cent of the variance reduction. PCs for GRACE solutions RL04 from CSR and GFZ are filtered with a cosine taper (degrees 20–40) and a Gaussian window (350 km). Significant differences are evident between GRACE solutions from different groups and filters, though they all agree reasonably well with the global hydrological models for the predominantly seasonal signal. We estimate the first PC at 10-d sampling to be accurate to 1 $\mu$Gal for GGP data, 1.5 $\mu$Gal for GRACE data and 1 $\mu$Gal between the three global hydrological models. Within these limits the CNES/GRGS solution and ground GGP data agree at the 79 per cent level, and better when the GGP solution is restricted to the three above-ground stations. The major limitation on the GGP side comes from the water mass distribution surrounding the underground instruments that leads to a complex gravity effect. To solve this we propose a method for correcting the SG residual gravity series for the effects of soil moisture above the station.},

Numerical studies show that the gradients Tzz, Txx, Tyy and Txz have similar capability of being continued downward to sea level in the presence of white noise, while the gradient Tyz is considerably worse than the others. The bias-corrected joint inversion process shows the possibility of recovering the gravity anomaly with 1mGal accuracy.

@article{Zamaro2016,
abstract = {One of the paramount stepping stones towards NASA's long-term goal of undertaking human missions to Mars is the exploration of the Martian moons. Since a precursor mission to Phobos would be easier than landing on Mars itself, NASA is targeting this moon for future exploration, and ESA has also announced Phootprint as a candidate Phobos sample-and-return mission. Orbital dynamics around small planetary satellites are particularly complex because many strong perturbations are involved, and the classical circular restricted three-body problem (R3BP) does not provide an accurate approximation to describe the system's dynamics. Phobos is a special case, since the combination of a small mass-ratio and length-scale means that the sphere-of-influence of the moon moves very close to its surface. Thus, an accurate nonlinear model of a spacecraft's motion in the vicinity of this moon must consider the additional perturbations due to the orbital eccentricity and the complete gravity field of Phobos, which is far from a spherical-shaped body, and it is incorporated into an elliptic R3BP using the gravity harmonics series-expansion (ER3BP-GH). In this paper, a showcase of various classes of non-keplerian orbits is identified and a number of potential mission applications in the Mars-Phobos system are proposed: these results could be exploited in upcoming unmanned missions targeting the exploration of this Martian moon. These applications include: low-thrust hovering and orbits around Phobos for close-range observations; the dynamical substitutes of periodic and quasi-periodic Libration Point Orbits in the ER3BP-GH to enable unique low-cost operations for space missions in the proximity of Phobos; their manifold structure for high-performance landing/take-off maneuvers to and from Phobos' surface and for transfers from and to Martian orbits; Quasi-Satellite Orbits for long-period station-keeping and maintenance. In particular, these orbits could exploit Phobos' occulting bulk and shadowing wake as a passive radiation shield during future manned flights to Mars to reduce human exposure to radiation, and the latter orbits can be used as an orbital garage, requiring no orbital maintenance, where a spacecraft could make planned pit-stops during a round-trip mission to Mars.},

abstract = {A decade ago, a novel theoretical approach was developed (Dickman, 1998) for determining the dynamic response of the oceans to atmospheric pressure variations, a response nicknamed the \\textquotedblleftdynamic barometer\\textquotedblright (DB), and the effects of that response on Earth\\textquoterights rotation. This approach employed a generalized, spherical harmonic ocean tide model to compute oceanic Green\\textquoterights functions, the oceans\\textquoteright fluid dynamic response to unit-amplitude pressure forcing on various spatial and temporal scales, and then construct rotational Green\\textquoterights functions, representing the rotational effects of that response. When combined with the observed atmospheric pressure field, the rotational Green\\textquoterights functions would yield the effects of the DB on Earth\\textquoterights rotation. The Green\\textquoterights functions reflect in some way the geographical and spectral sensitivity of the oceans to atmospheric pressure forcing. We have formulated a measure of that sensitivity using a simple combination of rotational Green\\textquoterights functions. We find that the DB response of the oceans to atmospheric pressure forcing depends significantly on geographic location and on frequency. Compared to the inverted barometer (IB) (the traditional static model), the DB effects differ slightly at long periods but become very different at shorter periods. Among all the responses, the prograde polar motion effects are the most dynamic, with large portions of the North Atlantic and some of the North Pacific no larger than one third of IB, but most of the Southern Hemisphere oceans at least 50% greater than IB.},

abstract = {Throughout the past decade, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has given an unprecedented view on global variations in terrestrial water storage. While an increasing number of case studies have provided a rich overview on regional analyses, a global assessment on the dominant features of GRACE variability is still lacking. To address this, we survey key features of temporal variability in the GRACE record by decomposing gridded time series of monthly equivalent water height into linear trends, inter-annual, seasonal, and subseasonal (intra-annual) components. We provide an overview of the relative importance and spatial distribution of these components globally. A correlation analysis with precipitation and temperature reveals that both the inter-annual and subseasonal anomalies are tightly related to fluctuations in the atmospheric forcing. As a novelty, we show that for large regions of the world high-frequency anomalies in the monthly GRACE signal, which have been partly interpreted as noise, can be statistically reconstructed from daily precipitation once an adequate averaging filter is applied. This filter integrates the temporally decaying contribution of precipitation to the storage changes in any given month, including earlier precipitation. Finally, we also survey extreme dry anomalies in the GRACE record and relate them to documented drought events. This global assessment sets regional studies in a broader context and reveals phenomena that had not been documented so far.},

From Duplicate 2 (Recovery of the static gravity field with Inclined Pendulum Formation - Jiang, Weiping; Liu, Wei; Xu, Xinyu; Zou, Xiancai; Zhao, Qian)

Summary



The article describes the numerical experiments of a number of pendulum formations with the purpose of retrieving the gravity field. The pendulum formations is described by two parameters, the initial inclined angle (which is the azimuth angle of the inter-satellite vector) and the initial inter-satellite range (which is the distance between the satellites). Both parameters are defined only when the formation is crossing the equator.

A number of simulations is conducted for difference values of the two parameters (while the other parameters is kept constant at a pre-defined value). The simulations results are analysed in the frequency domain (with error amplitude per degree plots) and in the spatial domain (by the means of spatial maps).


General remarks

The article is generally poorly written, occasionally showing that little review was done by the authors. There are some sentences which are difficult to understand and are grammatically incorrect. Many terms are introduced without proper explanation.

The authors have reached a few interesting conclusions: they have shown that the East-West sensitivity of the ll-sst data contributes more significantly to estimate the (near) sectorial coefficients and that the North-South data sensitivity helps to determine the zonal and tesseral coefficients. They have also found that, under the assumptions of the conducted study, a pendulum formation with an initial inclined angle within the range of 45 to 60 degrees produces the lowest error and most isotropic error pattern. These results should be understood in the context that the validity of the assumptions is not necessarily general enough (see below).



Major Issues



The purpose of the numerical experiment is not clear. The titles states that it is for the recovery of the static gravity field but this is never mentioned explicitly on the text. Furthermore, at line 12-13 of page 9, they clearly state “we want to obtain the monthly gravity field” and proceed to motivate the choice of orbital repeat period based on this.

The conducted research seems unfinished, with the research skipping important details, such as: i) the simulation of time-varying gravity field, ii) the over-simplistic noise model (which considers only white noise and a limited number of error sources, when e.g. Ditmar 2012 has shown that the errors in GRACE data are coloured and of numerous types), and iii) the small maximum degree considered in the estimation of the error models. These issues make the conclusions drawn from the numerical study weaker since they are not general enough.

The simulation of temporal aliasing is avoided by retrieving the static gravity field. I'm afraid this is a very bad motivation to look at the static gravity field retrieval with ll-sst data. The GRACE/GOCE satellites have advanced the knowledge of the static gravity field considerably, much more than what is conceivably achievable with ll-sst data alone. As a result, the only valuable application for ll-sst data is to measure the time-variable gravity field. Unless the authors are able to show that the mission they propose can compete with the GRACE/GOCE data (maybe at degrees below 100, where the contribution of the GOCE data is not as high as that of GRACE), I strongly suggest they consider the temporal component of the gravity field.

The choice of maximum degree of the estimated gravity field error models is badly motivated. The authors say that “it is enough to show the error pattern of the IPF”. The error pattern at low degrees (below degree 60) is not necessarily representative of the error pattern at high degrees (above degree 100). Furthermore, independently of the aim of the paper, i.e. to study the retrieval of static or time-varying gravity field estimation (which is not clear), degree 60 is surely much too low. The time varying gravity field is routinely estimated from GRACE data up to degree 120 and satellite-only static gravity field solutions (which use, amongst others, GOCE data) go up to degree 250. Unless the authors can prove that the proposed IPF improves in particular the solution up to degree 60 relatively to existing real data solutions, there is little point in restricting the simulation to that degree.

There is a major drawback of the IPF as defined in the paper (i.e. with only difference on the longitude of the ascending node): the satellites are at minimum distance consistently at the poles, which means that the data at the polar areas is always of lower quality (because data collected with small inter satellite distance is less sensitive to long wavelength features of the gravity field). This deficiency of the simulated pendulum formations should be addressed by the authors, otherwise they risk reporting overly conservative results. By adding a small difference in orbital inclination between the orbits of the two satellites, the cross-over point (when the satellites are closest to each other) is shifted to a lower latitude. This point moves over different geographical locations (at the same latitude) as the Earth rotates in inertial space.

@article{Luo2015a,
abstract = {We present a new method to derive 3-D surface deformation from an integration of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations based on Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC), considering relationship between deformations of neighbouring locations. This method avoids interpolated errors by excluding the interpolation of GNSS into the same spatial resolution as InSAR images and harnesses the data sets and the prior smooth constraints of surface deformation objectively and simultaneously by using ABIC, which were inherently unresolved in previous studies. In particular, we define surface roughness measuring smoothing degree to evaluate the performance of the prior constraints and deduce the formula of the covariance for the estimation errors to estimate the uncertainty of modelled solution. We validate this method using synthetic tests and the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. We find that the optimal weights associated with ABIC minimum are generally at trade-off locations that balance contributions from InSAR, GNSS data sets and the prior constraints. We use this method to evaluate the influence of the interpolated errors from the Ordinary Kriging algorithm on the derivation of surface deformation. Tests show that the interpolated errors may contribute to biasing very large weights imposed on Kriged GNSS data, suggesting that fixing the relative weights is required in this case. We also make a comparison with SISTEM method, indicating that our method allows obtaining better estimations even with sparse GNSS observations. In addition, this method can be generalized to provide a solution for situations where some types of data sets are lacking and can be exploited further to account for data sets such as the integration of displacements along radar lines and offsets along satellite tracks.},

@article{Zhang2014b,
abstract = {Ionospheric disturbances can be detrimental to accuracy and reliability of GNSS positioning. We focus on how ionospheric scintillation induces significant degradation to Precise Point Positioning (PPP) and how to improve the performance of PPP during ionospheric scintillation periods. We briefly describe these problems and give the physical explanation of highly correlated phenomenon of degraded PPP estimates and occurrence of ionospheric scintillation. Three possible reasons can contribute to significant accuracy degradation in the presence of ionospheric scintillation: (a) unexpected loss of lock of tracked satellites which greatly reduces the available observations and considerably weakens the geometry, (b) abnormal blunders which are not properly mitigated by positioning programs, and (c) failure of cycle slip detection algorithms due to the high rate of total electronic content. The latter two reasons are confirmed as the major causes of sudden accuracy degradation by means of a comparative analysis. To reduce their adverse effect on positioning, an improved approach based on a robust iterative Kalman filter is adopted to enhance the PPP performance. Before the data enter the filter, the differential code biases are used for GNSS data quality checking. Any satellite whose C1-P1 and P1-P2 biases exceed 10 and 30 m, respectively, will be rejected. Both the Melbourne-Wubbena and geometry-free combination are used for cycle slip detection. But the thresholds are set more flexibly when ionospheric conditions become unusual. With these steps, most of the outliers and cycle slips can be effectively detected, and a first PPP estimation can be carried out. Furthermore, an iterative PPP estimator is utilized to mitigate the remaining gross errors and cycle slips which will be reflected in the posterior residuals. Further validation tests based on extensive experiments confirm our physical explanation and the new approach. The results show that the improved approach effectively avoids a large number of ambiguity resets which would otherwise be necessary. It reduces the number of re-parameterized phase ambiguities by approximately half, without scarifying the accuracy and reliability of the PPP solution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Retreat of mountain glaciers is a significant contributor to sea-level rise and a potential threat to human populations through impacts on water availability and regional hydrology. Like most of Earth's mountain glaciers, those in western North America are experiencing rapid mass loss. Projections of future large-scale mass change are based on surface mass balance models that are open to criticism, because they ignore or greatly simplify glacier physics. Here we use a high-resolution regional glaciation model, developed by coupling physics-based ice dynamics with a surface mass balance model, to project the fate of glaciers in western Canada. We use twenty-first-century climate scenarios from an ensemble of global climate models in our simulations; the results indicate that by 2100, the volume of glacier ice in western Canada will shrink by 70 ± 10% relative to 2005. According to our simulations, few glaciers will remain in the Interior and Rockies regions, but maritime glaciers, in particular those in northwestern British Columbia, will survive in a diminished state. We project the maximum rate of ice volume loss, corresponding to peak input of deglacial meltwater to streams and rivers, to occur around 2020–2040. Potential implications include impacts on aquatic ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, alpine tourism and water quality.},

abstract = {This report provides a detailed performance analysis of three semicodeless dual-frequency GPS receivers for use in low Earth orbit (LEO). The test set comprises the IGOR receiver, which represents a follow-on of the flight-proven BlackJack receiver, as well as two geodetic receivers (NovAtel OEM4-G2 and Septentrio PolaRx2), which are entirely based on commercial-off-the-shelf technology (COTS). All three receivers are considered for upcoming flight projects or experiments and have undergone at least a preliminary environmental qualification program. Using extensive signal simulator tests, the cold start signal acquisition, tracking sensitivity, differential code biases, raw measurement accuracy, and navigation accuracy of each receiver have been assessed. All tests are based on a common scenario that is representative of an actual space mission and provides a realistic simulation of the signal dynamics and quality on a scientific LEO satellite. Compared to the other receivers, the IGOR instrument exhibits a superior tracking sensitivity and is thus best suited for occultation measurements with low tangent point altitudes. The OEM4-G2 and PolaRx2 receivers are likewise shown to properly track dual-frequency GPS signals and normal signal levels and to provide accurate code and carrier phase measurements. Given their limited resource requirements, these receivers appear well suited for precise orbit determination applications and ionospheric sounding onboard of microsatellites with tight mission budgets.},

This\npermits, for example, the combination of gravity data at the surface\nof the Earth and data at satellite altitude, when the orbit is circular.\nSuppose that data are associated with the points of a grid with N\nvalues in latitude and M values in longitude. The latitudes do not\nneed to be spaced uniformly. Also suppose that it is required to\ndetermine the spherical harmonic coefficients to a maximal degree\nand order K. Then the method will require that we solve K systems\nof equations each having a symmetric positive definite matrix of\nonly N ?� N. Results of simulation studies using the method are described.},

Accurate density calculations are required to provide meaningful estimates of the atmospheric drag perturbing satellite motion. This paper uses precision satellite orbits from the Challenging Mini Satellite Payload (CHAMP) as measurements in an optimal orbit determination process. The accuracy of the precision orbit derived density is compared to CHAMP accelerometer derived density for various filter/smoother settings to calibrate the precision orbit derived densities. Settings studied include the half-lives of the ballistic coefficient and density estimate Gauss– Markov processes, solution time spans, and baseline density models. The precision orbit derived densities are shown to more closely match the accelerometer derived densities along the CHAMP orbit than either the Jacchia 1971 empirical model or the High Accuracy Satellite Drag Model.},

@article{Liu2010,
abstract = {SUMMARY The DEOS Mass Transport release 1 (DMT-1) model has been produced on the basis of intersatellite K-band ranging data acquired by the GRACE satellite mission. The functional model exploited in the data processing can be considered as a variant of the acceleration approach. Each element of the data vector is defined as a linear combination of three successive range measurements and can be interpreted as the line-of-sight projection of a weighted average of intersatellite accelerations. As such, the data vector can be directly linked to parameters of the gravitational field. In this way, a series of unconstrained monthly gravity field solutions is produced, each of which is defined as a set of spherical harmonic coefficients complete to degree 120. At the post-processing stage, the unconstrained solutions are filtered with a statistically optimal Wiener-type filter based on full covariance matrices of noise and signal. As such, the DMT-1 model is free from along-track artefacts, which are typical for many other GRACE gravity models. The accuracy of the DMT-1 model has been analysed in different ways. First, the signals observed in areas with minimal mass variations (Sahara, East Antarctica and the middle of the Pacific Ocean) are analysed and interpreted as an upper bound of the noise in the DMT-1 model. It is concluded that the pointwise errors after filtering are of the order of 2–3 cm in terms of equivalent water heights. For the mean mass variations in an area of 106 km2, the corresponding error reduces to 1.5–2 cm. Second, a time-series of mass variations in the Marie Byrd Land (Antarctica) has been analysed, where the true signal (mostly caused by postglacial rebound) is expected to be close to a linear trend. The rms of the post-fit residuals is found to be 3.3 cm, which is consistent with the error analysis in areas with minimal mass variations. Thirdly, the DMT-1 model has been applied to estimate mass variations in 2003–2006 in Lake Victoria (Africa), where a large drop of water level is observed in recent years. The obtained linear trend (−31 ± 3 cm yr−1) is in good agreement with that derived from the satellite altimetry data (−35 ± 1 cm yr−1).},

abstract = {While multiple data sources have confirmed that Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate, different measurement techniques estimate the details of its geographically highly variable mass balance with different levels of accuracy, spatio-temporal resolution, and coverage. Some scope remains for methodological improvements using a single data type. In this study we report our progress in increasing the accuracy and spatial resolution of time-variable gravimetry from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). We determine the geographic pattern of ice mass change in Antarctica between January 2003 and June 2014, accounting for glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) using the IJ05_R2 model. Expressing the unknown signal in a sparse Slepian basis constructed by optimization to prevent leakage out of the regions of interest, we use robust signal processing and statistical estimation methods. Applying those to the latest time series of monthly GRACE solutions we map Antarctica's mass loss in space and time as well as can be recovered from satellite gravity alone. Ignoring GIA model uncertainty, over the period 2003-2014, West Antarctica has been losing ice mass at a rate of -121??8Gt/yr and has experienced large acceleration of ice mass losses along the Amundsen Sea coast of -18??5Gt/yr2, doubling the mass loss rate in the past six years. The Antarctic Peninsula shows slightly accelerating ice mass loss, with larger accelerated losses in the southern half of the Peninsula. Ice mass gains due to snowfall in Dronning Maud Land have continued to add about half the amount of West Antarctica's loss back onto the continent over the last decade. We estimate the overall mass losses from Antarctica since January 2003 at -92??10Gt/yr.},

This concerns, above all, the adaptation to the fact that the geometry can now be precisely determined by methods such as GPS, and that new satellite methods, combined with terrestrial methods, also make a detailed determination of the earth's gravitational field a possibility and a necessity. Highlights include: emphasis on global integration of geometry and gravity, a simplified approach to Molodensky's theory without integral equations, and a general combination of all geodetic data by least-squares collocation.

abstract = {The structure and variability of Southern Ocean fronts south of New Zealand are described based on fifteen summer expendable bathythermograph (XBT) sections obtained between 1994 and 2001. The temperature variability north of 60�S is dominated by meanders and meridional shifts of the Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF), which often bifurcates to form northern and southern branches. The northern branch follows the southern edge of the Campbell Plateau, while the southern branch is found over the abyssal plain of the south-west Pacific Basin. The northern and southern branches of the SAF can be separated by as much as 900 km. Intense eddies or meanders of the SAF displace isotherms by as much as 5 degrees of latitude from their positions when such features are absent. The Polar Front (PF) position is more stable in time, although cold-core features associated with eddies or meanders of the front are occasionally observed between the southern SAF and the PF. The position of the southern ACC front is extremely stable, consistently overlying the 3000 m isobath on the northern flank of the Pacific-Antarctic/south-east Indian Ridge.},

abstract = {With the development of precise point positioning (PPP), the School of Geodesy and Geomatics (SGG) at Wuhan University is now routinely producing GPS satellite fractional cycle bias (FCB) products with open access for worldwide PPP users to conduct ambiguity-fixed PPP solution. We provide a brief theoretical background of PPP and present the strategies and models to compute the FCB products. The practical realization of the two-step (wide-lane and narrow-lane) FCB estimation scheme is described in detail. With GPS measurements taken in various situations, i.e., static, dynamic, and on low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the quality of FCB estimation and the effectiveness of PPP ambiguity resolution (AR) are evaluated. The comparison with CNES FCBs indicated that our FCBs had a good consistency with the CNES ones. For wide-lane FCB, almost all the differences of the two products were within ±0.05 cycles. For narrow-lane FCB, 87.8 % of the differences were located between ±0.05 cycles, and 97.4 % of them were located between ±0.075 cycles. The experimental results showed that, compared with conventional ambiguity-float PPP, the averaged position RMS of static PPP can be improved from (3.6, 1.4, 3.6) to (2.0, 1.0, 2.7) centimeters for ambiguity-fixed PPP. The average accuracy improvement in the east, north, and up components reached 44.4, 28.6, and 25.0 %, respectively. A kinematic, ambiguity-fixed PPP test with observation of 80 min achieved a position accuracy of better than 5 cm at the one-sigma level in all three coordinate components. Compared with the results of ambiguity-float, kinematic PPP, the positioning biases of ambiguity-fixed PPP were improved by about 78.2, 20.8, and 65.1 % in east, north, and up. The RMS of LEO PPP test was improved by about 23.0, 37.0, and 43.0 % for GRACE-A and GRACE-B in radial, tangential, and normal directions when AR was applied to the same data set. These results demonstrated that the SGG FCB products can be produced with high quality for users anywhere around the world to carry out ambiguity-fixed PPP solutions.},

abstract = {This paper presents an innovative space mission devoted to the survey of the small Earth companion asteroid by means of nano platforms. Also known as the second Earth Moon, Cruithne, is the target identified for the mission. Both the trajectory to reach the target and a preliminary spacecraft budget are here detailed. The idea is to exploit high efficient ion thrusters to reduce the propellant mass fraction in such a high total impulse mission (of the order of 1e6 Ns). This approach allows for a 100 kg class spacecraft with a very small Earth escape energy (5 km2/s2) to reach the destination in about 320 days. The 31% propellant mass fraction allows for a payload mass fraction of the order of 8% and this is sufficient to embark on such a small spacecraft a couple of nano-satellites deployed once at the target to carry out a complete survey of the asteroid. Two 2U Cubesats are here considered as representative payload, but also other scientific payloads or different platforms might be considered according with the specific mission needs. The small spacecraft used to transfer these to the target guarantees the manoeuvre capabilities during the interplanetary journey, the protection against radiations along the path and the telecommunication relay functions for the data transmission with Earth stations. The approach outlined in the paper offers reliable solutions to the main issues associated with a deep space nano-satellite mission thus allowing the exploitation of distant targets by means of these tiny spacecraft. The study presents an innovative general strategy for the NEO observation and Cruithne is chosen as test bench. This target, however, mainly for its relevant inclination, requires a relatively large propellant mass fraction that can be reduced if low inclination asteroids are of interest. This might increase the payload mass fraction (e.g. additional Cubesats and/or additional scientific payloads on the main bus) for the same 100 kg class mission.},

abstract = {The Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) have been used to respectively determine the Earth's surface deformation and gravity changes associated with glacial isostatic adjustment, which is caused by ongoing stress release of the viscoelastic mantle after removal of the Late Pleistocene ice sheets. Here we present a joint inversion analysis of GPS-derived radial (vertical) deformation and GRACE-derived gravity rates in North America to examine whether the ice sheets (ICE-3G and ICE-5G) and earth models can fit the satellite based observations. The results of joint inversion give an effective lithosphere thickness of 150 km (110–180 km under a statistical confidence level of 80 per cent), an upper-mantle viscosity of 3.7 (2.0–5.0; 90 per cent confidence level) × 1020 Pa s, and a lower-mantle viscosity of 1.9 (1.3–2.6; 90 per cent confidence level) × 1021 Pa s. More sophisticated models such as introducing a transition zone of 400–670 km are not fully resolved with current data sets because there is no significant improvement in fitting observations. Tests of modifying ICE-5G show that a reduction of ice thickness by ∼20 per cent in the area west of Hudson Bay and an increase by ∼40 per cent in the southeast (Quebec region) are required to fit both observed vertical deformation and gravity changes. An additional test from inversion analysis of GRACE-derived geoid rates confirms possible signal loss in the GRACE-derived gravity rates, which could be due to noise reduction methods used in data processing stages.},

abstract = {After 10 years as a service of the International Association of Geodesy, the International GPS Service IGS is preparing for the future use of multiple integrated global navigation satellite systems: GPS and its modernisation, Galileo and GLONASS. Since 1994, the IGS produces GPS data and products at the highest level of precision and accuracy available anywhere: it provides GPS orbits with 3-5 cm accuracy, sub-centimetre station positions and velocities, and station and satellite clocks at the sub-nanosecond level for users world-wide. A similar suite of data and products is available for GLONASS, demonstrating the ability of the IGS to incorporate observations from other GNSSs, such as Galileo. IGS affirms its interest to contribute to the development and applications of the Galileo programme and other GNSS. IGS currently consists of over 200 actively contributing organizations in more than 80 countries and a global network of more than 350 stations. The working groups and pilot projects of the IGS demonstrate IGS involvement in applications related to the precise global reference frame, timing, ionosphere, atmospheric water vapour, low Earth orbiter precise orbit determination (LEO POD), sea level change measurements, real-time GPS applications, and GNSS developments. {\textcopyright} 2005 COSPAR.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.The Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP), i.e.The spin axis of the Earth, is influenced by the mass redistribution inside and on the surface of the Earth. On the Earth surface, global ice melting, sea level change and atmospheric circulation are the prime contributors. Recent studies have unraveled the majority of the mysteries behind the Chandler wobble, the annual motion and the secular motion of the pole. The differences from the motion of a pole for a rigid Earth is indeed due to the mass redistribution and transfer of angular momentum among the atmosphere, the oceans and solid Earth. The technique of laser ranging and the use of laser ranged satellites such as LARES along with other techniques such Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) allow to measure the EOP with accuracies at the level of ∼200 $\mu$as which correspond to few millimeters at the Earth's surface, while the use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data can reach an accuracy even below 100 $\mu$as. At these unprecedented high levels of accuracy, even tiny anomalous behavior in EOP can be observed and thus correlated to global environmental changes such as ice melting on Greenland and the polar caps, and extreme events that involve strong ocean-Atmosphere coupling interactions such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o. The contribution of Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) data such as from the LARES mission and similar satellites to this area is outlined in this paper.},

abstract = {Currently, various satellite processing centers produce extensive data, with different solutions of the same field being available. For instance, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has been monitoring terrestrial water storage (TWS) since April 2002, while the Center for Space Research (CSR), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ), and the Groupe de Recherche de G{\'{e}}od{\'{e}}sie Spatiale (GRGS) provide individual monthly solutions in the form of Stokes coefficients. The inverted TWS maps (or the regionally averaged values) from these coefficients are being used in many appli-cations; however, as no ground truth data exist, the uncertainties are unknown. Consequently, the purpose of this work is to assess the quality of each processing center by estimating their uncer-tainties using a generalized formulation of the three-cornered hat (TCH) method. Overall, the TCH results for the study period of August 2002 to June 2014 indicate that at a global scale, the CSR, GFZ, GRGS, and JPL presented uncertainties of 9.4, 13.7, 14.8, and 13.2 mm, respec-tively. At a basin scale, the overall good performance of the CSR was observed at 91 river basins. The TCH-based results were confirmed by a comparison with an ensemble solution from the four GRACE processing centers.},

abstract = {A framework for constructing circulant and block circulant preconditioners (C) for a symmetric linear system Ax=b arising fro msignal and image processing applications is presented in this paper. The propsed scheme does not make explicit use of matrix elements of A. It is ideal for applications in which A only exists in the form of a matrix vector multiplication routine, and in which the process of extracting matrix elements of A is costly. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the fact that for many linear systems arising from signal or image processing applications, eigenvectors of A can be well represented by a small number of Fourier modes. Therefore, the construction of C can be carried out in the frequency domain by carefully choosing the eigenvalues of C so that the condition number of C'AC can be reduced significantly. We illustrate how to construct the spectrum of C in a way that allows the smallest eigenvalues of C'AC to overlap with those of A extremely well while making the largest eigenvalues of C'AC several orders of magnitude smaller than those of A. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner on accelerating the solution of linear systems arising from image reconstruction applications.},

@article{Dirkx2015d,
abstract = {Many physical parameters that can be estimated from space mission tracking data influence both the translational dynamics and proper time rates of observers. These different proper time rates cause a variability of the time transfer observable beyond that caused by their translational (and rotational) dynamics. With the near-future implementation of (interplanetary) transponder laser ranging, these effects will become increasingly important, requiring a re-evaluation of the common data analysis practice of using a priori time ephemerides, which is the goal of this paper. We develop a framework for the simultaneous estimation of the initial translational state and the initial proper time of an observer, with the goal of facilitating robust tracking data analysis from next-generation space missions carrying highly accurate clocks and tracking equipment. Using our approach, the influence of physical parameters on both translational and time dynamics are considered at the same level in the analysis, and mutual correlations between the signatures of the two are automatically identified. We perform a covariance analysis using our proposed method with simulated laser data from Earth-based stations to both a Mars and Mercury lander. Using four years of tracking data for the Mars lander simulations, we find a difference between our results using the simultaneous space-time dynamics estimation and the classical analysis technique (with an ta priori time ephemeris) of around 0.1 % in formal errors and correlation coefficients. For a Mercury lander this rises to around 1% for a 1-month mission and 10 % for a 4-year mission. By means of Monte Carlo simulation, we find that using an a priori time ephemeris of representative accuracy will result in estimation errors that are orders of magnitude above the formal error when processing highly accurate laser time transfer data.},

It is the first satellite that provides us with position and accelerometer measurements, with which the gravity field model can be determined. One of the most popular methods for geopotential recovery using the position and accelerometer measurements of CHAMP is the energy conservation method. The main aim of this paper is to determine the scale and bias parameters of CHAMP accelerometer data using the energy conservation method. The basic principle and mathematical model using the crossover points of CHAMP orbit to calibrate the accelerometer data are given based on the energy balance method. The rigorous integral formula as well as its discete form of the observational equation is presented. This method can be used to estimate only one of the scale and bias parameters or both of them. In order to control the influence of outliers, the robust estimator for the calibration parameters is given. The results of the numerical computations and comparisons using the CHAMP accelerometer data show the validity of the method.},

Prior impact simulations predict that much of the disk material originates from the colliding planet. However, Earth and the Moon have essentially identical oxygen isotope compositions. This has been a challenge for the impact theory, because the impactor's composition would have likely differed from that of Earth. We simulated impacts involving larger impactors than previously considered. We show that these can produce a disk with the same composition as the planet's mantle, consistent with Earth-Moon compositional similarities. Such impacts require subsequent removal of angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system through a resonance with the Sun as recently proposed.},

abstract = {Progress in atomic, optical and quantum science has led to rapid improvements in atomic clocks. At the same time, atomic clock research has helped to advance the frontiers of science, affecting both fundamental and applied research. The ability to control quantum states of individual atoms and photons is central to quantum information science and precision measurement, and optical clocks based on single ions have achieved the lowest systematic uncertainty of any frequency standard. Although many-atom lattice clocks have shown advantages in measurement precision over trapped-ion clocks, their accuracy has remained 16 times worse. Here we demonstrate a many-atom system that achieves an accuracy of 6.4 × 10−18, which is not only better than a single-ion-based clock, but also reduces the required measurement time by two orders of magnitude. By systematically evaluating all known sources of uncertainty, including in situ monitoring of the blackbody radiation environment, we improve the accuracy of optical lattice clocks by a factor of 22. This single clock has simultaneously achieved the best known performance in the key characteristics necessary for consideration as a primary standard—stability and accuracy. More stable and accurate atomic clocks will benefit a wide range of fields, such as the realization and distribution of SI units, the search for time variation of fundamental constants, clock-based geodesy and other precision tests of the fundamental laws of nature. This work also connects to the development of quantum sensors and many-body quantum state engineering (such as spin squeezing) to advance measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit.},

@article{Cheng1999a,
abstract = {Seasonal variations in the Earth's gravity field were determined using satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations from multisatellite. The time series for the variations of the even zonal harmonics, Jl (l = 2, 4, 6, and 8), were determined using the SLR data from the geodetic satellites, including Starlette, Ajisai, Stella, LAGEOS I and LAGEOS II, during the period from October 1993 to December 1996. Owing to uncertainties in the eccentricity excitation for LAGEOS I and II, the variations of J 3 and J 5 were determined using only the SLR data from Starlette, Ajisai, and Stella. The seasonal variations of J 2, J 4, J 6 and J 8 become separable using the existing multisatellite SLR data sets collected in 15-day time intervals. The amplitude (normalized and in units of 10&#8722;10) and phase (in a cosine conversion and in units of degrees) for the annual variation in Jl (l= 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8) are estimated to be (1.25 � 0.1, 140 � 10), (2.16 � 0.21, 341 � 19), (1.07 � 0.1, 338 � 15), (1.12 � 0.16, 152 � 16), (0.26 � 0.17, 337 � 9), and (1.03 � .016, 209 � 10), respectively. The observed annual variations of J 3 and J 5 are essentially opposite in phase. This phenomenon results in a different lumped sum effect for various satellites. For example, the lumped sum of J 3 and J 5 annual variation from LAGEOS I is twice as large as that from Starlette. The excitation due to the mass redistribution in the atmosphere and ocean and the changes in continental water storage were considered in this study using the available global geophysical data, which included the European Centre for Medium-Rang Weather Forecasts atmospheric surface pressure, the TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry derived sea surface anomalies, and the World Monthly Surface Station Climatic Data. Overall, the variation in the even zonal coefficients due to the atmospheric mass redistribution is responsible for 30% to 60% of the observed annual variations in the node residual for Starlette and LAGEOS I. Comparison indicates that the oceanic mass movement, in particular, the continental water change produce comparable contributions to the seasonal zonal variations. The amplitude of the observed annual variation of J 2 is found to fall between the values predicted from the models of the surface water, ocean, and atmosphere with and without the inverted barometer (IB) oceanic response, but the phase is in good agreement with the IB models. The nontidal mass redistributions in atmosphere, ocean, and continental water change can only account for &#8764;13% of the semiannual variation in J 2 but are the primary excitation sources for semiannual variations in the higher-degree zonal terms.},

abstract = {We compute the radially symmetric coherence between multibeam bathymetry and satellite gravity grids in 25 areas distributed around the world. In contrast to previous studies employing onedimensional analysis of data along profiles, our results cannot be biased by unseen off-track topography. The mean coherence averaged over the 20−160 km waveband, and the shortest wavelength at which coherence is above 0.5, vary with tectonic setting. Seamounts and slow spreading ridges have high (>0.7) mean coherence down to $\sim$20 km wavelength, other spreading ridges and trenches have intermediate (0.5 – 0.7) coherence down to $\sim$20 – 30 km wavelength, and continental shelves have low (<0.5) coherence at all wavelengths. In the areas with highest mean coherence, the shortest wavelength at which coherence is above 0.5 decreases as mean depth decreases. The filter employed in the bathymetric prediction method of Smith and Sandwell (1994) selects the most coherent parts of the bathymetry and gravity spectrum.},

@article{Boucher2014,
abstract = {Global Geodetic Observatories (GGO) play an increasingly important role both for scientific and societal applications, in particular for the maintenance and evolution of the reference frame and those applications that rely on the reference frame for their viability. The International Association of Geodesy (IAG), through the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS), is fully involved in coordinating the development of these systems and ensuring their quality, perenniality and accessibility. This paper reviews the current role, basic concepts, and some of the critical issues associated with the GGOs, and advocates for their expansion to enhance co-location with other observing techniques (gravity, meteorology, etc). The historical perspective starts with the MERIT campaign, followed by the creation of international services (IERS, IGS, ILRS, IVS, IDS, etc). It provides a basic definition of observing systems and observatories and the build up of the international networks and the role of co-locations in geodesy and geosciences and multi-technique processing and data products. This paper gives special attention to the critical topic of local surveys and tie vectors among co-located systems in sites; the agreement of space geodetic solutions and the tie vectors now place one of the most significant limitations on the quality of integrated data products, most notably the ITRF. This topic focuses on survey techniques, extrapolation to instrument reference points, computation techniques, systematic biases, and alignment of the individual technique reference frames into ITRF. The paper also discusses the design, layout and implementation of network infrastructure, including the role of GGOS and the benefit that would be achieved with better standardization and international governance.},

abstract = {Satellite altimeter sea surface height observations include the geocentric displacements caused by the pole tide, namely the response of the solid Earth and oceans to polar motion. Most users of these data remove these effects using a model that was developed more than 20 years ago. We describe two improvements to the pole tide model for satellite altimeter measurements. Firstly, we recommend an approach that improves the model for the response of the oceans by including the effects of self-gravitation, loading, and mass conservation. Our recommended approach also specifically includes the previously ignored displacement of the solid Earth due to the load of the ocean response, and includes the effects of geocenter motion. Altogether, this improvement amplifies the modeled geocentric pole tide by 15 %, or up to 2 mm of sea surface height displacement. We validate this improvement using two decades of satellite altimeter measurements. Secondly, we recommend that the altimetry pole tide model exclude geocentric sea surface displacements resulting from the long-term drift in polar motion. The response to this particular component of polar motion requires a more rigorous approach than is used by conventional models. We show that erroneously including the response to this component of polar motion in the pole tide model impacts interpretation of regional sea level rise by (Formula presented.)0.25 mm/year.},

abstract = {Recently, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has gained popularity in atmospheric science for the assimilation of data and the assessment of uncertainty in forecasts for complex, largescale problems. A handful of papers have discussed reservoir characterization applications of the EnKF, which can easily and quickly be coupled with any reservoir simulator. Neither adjoint code nor specific knowledge of simulator numerics is required for implementation of the EnKF. Moreover, data are assimilated (matched) as they become available; a suite of plausible reservoir models (the ensemble, set of ensemble members or suite or realizations) is continuously updated to honor data without rematching data assimilated previously. Because of these features, the method is far more efficient for history matching dynamic data than automatic history matching based on optimization algorithms. Moreover, the set of realizations provides a way to evaluate the uncertainty in reservoir description and performance predictions.\nHere we establish a firm theoretical relation between randomized maximum likelihood and the ensemble Kalman filter. Although we have previously generated reservoir characterization examples where the method worked well, here we also provide examples where the performance of EnKF does not provide a reliable characterization of uncertainty.},

It depicts reasonable mass variability all over the globe at a wide range of frequencies including multi-year trends, year-to-year variability, and seasonal variability even at very fine spatial scales, which is important for a realistic representation of spatial aliasing and leakage. In particular on these small spatial scales between 50 and 250 km, the model contains a range of signals that have not been reliably observed yet by satellite gravimetry. In addition, the updated Earth System Model provides substantial high-frequency variability at periods down to a few hours only, thereby allowing to critically test strategies for the minimization of temporal aliasing.},

abstract = {The Ranging And Nanosatellite Guidance Experiment (RANGE) cubesat mission was recently selected for a flight opportunity as part of the Skybox University Cubesat Partnership, with a tentative launch date scheduled for 2016. The RANGE mission involves two 1.5U cubesats flying in a leader-follower formation with the goal of improving the relative and absolute positioning capabilities of nanosatellites. The satellites' absolute positions will be tracked using GPS receivers synchronized with miniaturized atomic clocks, and will be validated using ground-based laser ranging measurements. The relative position of the satellites will be measured using an on-board compact laser ranging system, which will also double as a low-rate optical communication system. The satellites will not have an active propulsion system, so the separation distance of the satellites will be controlled through differential drag techniques. The results of the mission should serve to enable more advanced payloads and future mission concepts involving formations and constellations of nanosatellites. The presentation will give an overview of the mission design and status, as well as the key innovations and expected outcomes.},

abstract = {An extensive analysis of the gravitational capture of a scpacecraft by Jupiter is performed for the main regions of interest around this planet. Four different dynamical models are used to study the problem. Our methodology is analogous to the one used to study the gravitational capture maneuvers in the Earth-Moon system. However, here the motion of the spacecraft is free to occupy the three-dimensional space rather than been limited to the orbital plane of the primaries, that is the most usual approach available in the literature. Similarly to what was done in the Earth-Moon system, the two-body energy Jupiter-spacecraft is monitored all the time and an impulsive maneuver should be applied to complete the capture when the spacecraft reaches the periapsis of the close approach trajectory. Our results show that the presence of the oblateness of Jupiter in the dynamical model is essential to obtain lower values for the two-body energy in times that are not too long for practical missions. The Galilean satellites are also very important, and despite their contribution in the gravitational capture maneuver itself, they can be used as a source of swing-bys that decrease the two-body energy Jupiter-spacecraft},

abstract = {Fermoscandia is a key region for studying effects of glacial isostatic adjustment. The associated mass variations can be detected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, which observes the Earth's gravity field since April 2002, as well as by absolute gravimetry field campaigns. Since 2003, annual absolute gravity (AG) measurements have been performed in Fermoscandia by the Institut fur Erdmessung (IfE, Institute of Geodesy) of the Leibniz Universitat Hannover, Germany, within a multi-national cooperation. This offers a unique opportunity for validation and evaluation of the GRACE results. In this preliminary study, the GRACE results are compared to secular gravity changes based on the surveys from 2004 to 2007 with the FG5-220 gravimeter of the IfE. The results from GRACE monthly solutions provided by different analysis centres show temporal gravity variations in Fennoscandia. The included secular variations are in good agreement with former studies. The uplift centre is located west of the Bothnian Bay, the whole uplift area comprises Northern Europe. Nevertheless, the differences between the GRACE solutions are larger than expected and the different centre-specific processing techniques have a very strong effect on possible interpretations of GRACE results. The comparison of GRACE to the AG measurements reveals that the determined trends fit well with results from GRACE at selected stations, especially for the solution provided by the GFZ. Variations of land hydrology clearly influence results from GRACE and the AG measurements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) products provide valuable information about total water storage variations over the whole globe. Since GRACE detects mass variations integrated over vertical columns, it is desirable to separate its total water storage anomalies into their original sources. Among the statistical approaches, the principal component analysis (PCA) method and its extensions have been frequently proposed to decompose the GRACE products into space and time components. However, these methods only search for decorrelated components that on the one hand are not always interpretable and on the other hand often contain a superposition of independent source signals. In contrast, independent component analysis (ICA) represents a technique that separates components based on assumed statistical independence using higher-order statistical information. If one assumes that independent physical processes generate statistically independent signal components added up in the GRACE observations, separating them by ICA is a reliable strategy to identify these processes. In this paper, the performance of the conventional PCA, its rotated extension and ICA are investigated when applied to the GRACE-derived total water storage variations. These analyses have been tested on both a synthetic example and on the real GRACE level-2 monthly solutions derived from GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ RL04) and Bonn University (ITG2010). Within the synthetic example, we can show how imposing statistical independence in the framework of ICA improves the extraction of the ‘original' signals from a GRACE-type super-position. We are therefore confident that also for the real case the ICA algorithm, without making prior assumptions about the long-term behaviour or on the frequencies contained in the signal, improves over the performance of PCA and its rotated extension in the separation of periodical and long-term components.},

@article{Weise2012,
abstract = {Time variable gravity field models derived from the satellite mission GRACE have been demonstrated to be consistent with water mass variations in the global hydrological cycle. Independent observations are provided by terrestrial measurements. In order to achieve a maximum of reliability and information gain, ground-based gravity observations may be deployed for comparison with the gravity field variations derived from the GRACE satellite mission. In this context, the data of the network of superconducting gravimeters (SG) of the 'Global Geodynamics Project' (GGP) are of particular interest. This study is focused on the dense SG network in Central Europe with its long-term gravity observations. It is shown that after the separation and reduction of local hydrological effects in the SG observations especially for subsurface stations, the time-variable gravity signals from GRACE agree well with the terrestrial observations from the SG station cluster. Station stability of the SG sites with respect to vertical deformations was checked by GNSS based observations. Most of the variability can be explained by loading effects due to changes in continental water storage, and, in general, the stability of all stations has been confirmed. From comparisons based on correlation and coherence analyses in combination with the root mean square (RMS) variability of the time series emerges, that the maximum correspondence between the SG and GRACE time series is achieved when filtering the GRACE data with Gaussian filters of about 1000. km filter length, which is in accordance with previous publications. Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) analysis was applied to the gravity time series in order to identify common characteristic spatial and temporal patterns. The high correspondence of the first modes for GRACE and SG data implies that the first EOF mode represents a large-scale (Central European) time-variable gravity signal seen by both the GRACE satellites and the SG cluster. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recently, 3D building models have become an important aid to many positioning methods such as LiDAR and GPS positioning. Creating an accurate 3D building model requires accurate 2D building boundaries. We propose a method to correct the horizontal location errors of the 3D building model using GPS measurements. In an urban canyon, several GPS signals are reflected by buildings, and these reflections are potentially capable of indicating the correct position of the buildings. Starting with a raw 3D building model, we apply a signal ray tracing method to track the simulated reflection path of the GPS signal. Theoretically, the length of observed reflection path, which is known as the non-line-of-sight pseudorange, and the length of simulated reflection path should be similar. However, if the 3D map is not accurate, a difference between the pseudorange and simulated range is found. Using this difference, the proposed method estimates the true position of the wall of the 3D map. Results show that the proposed method successfully corrects the position of the wall of the raw 3D map and achieves sub-meter accuracy.},

These jumps attain about 7 cm of equivalent water thickness\n(EWT) change in some regions including the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau\nand South America, and appear to be spurious biases caused by the\nresolution change in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather\nForecasts (ECMWF) model at the beginning of 2006 and 2010, respectively.\nThese uncovered jumps are unlikely to be real atmospheric signals\nprimarily because they are absent in the ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim)\nmodel. Here, we show that these spurious jumps, uncovered in both\nthe Release 04 (RL04) and the Release 05 (RL05) AOD1B data, would\nproduce jumps of the same magnitude with opposite signs, thus may\ncontaminate the GRACE data products in specific regions of the world.\nAs a consequence, estimates of regional mass changes including glacier\nmass balance could potentially have an error at the same level of\nthese jumps.},

@article{Hauschild2013a,
abstract = {A characterization of the short-term stability of the atomic frequency standards onboard GNSS satellites is presented. Clock performance is evaluated using two different methods. The first method derives the temporal variation of the satellite's clock from a polynomial fit through 1-way carrier-phase measurements from a receiver directly connected to a high-precision atomic frequency standard. Alternatively, three-way measurements using inter-station single differences of a second satellite from a neighboring station are used if the receiver's clock stability at the station tracking the satellite of interest is not sufficient. The second method is a Kalman-filter-based clock estimation based on dual-frequency pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements from a small global or regional tracking network. Both methods are introduced and their respective advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The analysis section presents a characterization of GPS, GLONASS, GIOVE, Galileo IOV, QZSS, and COMPASS clocks based on these two methods. Special focus has been set on the frequency standards of new generation satellites like GPS Block IIF, QZSS, and IOV as well as the Chinese COMPASS/BeiDou-2 system. The analysis shows results for the Allan deviation covering averaging intervals from 1 to 1,000 s, which is of special interest for real-time PPP and other high-rate applications like processing of radio-occultation measurements. The clock interpolation errors for different sampling rates are evaluated for different types of clocks and their effect on PPP is discussed.},

We find that in HMA area, there are three different kinds of signal sources that should be treated together. The two generally accepted sources, glacier melting and India underground water depletion, are estimated to change at the rate of 35.0 ± 5.8 Gt/yr (0.09 mm/yr sea level rising) and 30.6 ± 5.0 Gt/yr, respectively. The third source is the remarkable positive signal (+30 Gt/yr) in the inner Tibetan Plateau, which is challenging to explain. Further, we have found that there is a 5 year undulation in Pamir and Karakoram, which can explain the controversies of the previous studies on the glacier melting rate here. This 5 year signal can be explained by the influence of Arctic Oscillation and El Niño–Southern Oscillation.},

abstract = {Observations of spatio-temporal variations in the geopotential using the GRACE satellites have been used to estimate recent mass fluxes from polar ice sheets and glaciers. However, these estimates have not considered the potential bias associated with the migration of water that accompanies the ice melt. This migration is driven by the diminished gravitational attraction of the melting ice reservoir, and this migration, as well as the crustal loading it induces, will contribute to the observed geopotential anomaly. The extent to which this contribution contaminates the ice mass flux estimates depends on how far the smoothing filters applied to the GRACE data extend beyond the ice margins into the ocean. Using the Antarctic Peninsula as a case study, we estimate the magnitude of this bias for a range of melt areas and Gaussian smoothing filter radii. We conclude that GRACE estimates of ice mass loss over the Antarctic Peninsula are systematically overestimating the loss by up to 10 %\% for filter radii of less than 500 km.},

@article{Burgers1998a,
abstract = {Abstract This paper discusses an important issue related to the implementation and interpretation of the analysis scheme in the ensemble Kalman filter. It is shown that the observations must be treated as random variables at the analysis steps. That is, one should add random perturbations with the correct statistics to the observations and generate an ensemble of observations that then is used in updating the ensemble of model states. Traditionally, this has not been done in previous applications of the ensemble Kalman filter and, as will be shown, this has resulted in an updated ensemble with a variance that is too low. This simple modification of the analysis scheme results in a completely consistent approach if the covariance of the ensemble of model states is interpreted as the prediction error covariance, and there are no further requirements on the ensemble Kalman filter method, except for the use of an ensemble of sufficient size. Thus, there is a unique correspondence between the error statistics ...},

The reprocessing of this new GFZ RL05 time series is based on updated Level-1B instrument data, improved background models (e.g. a new model release to de-aliase atmospheric and oceanic short-term mass variations or use of static and time variable gravity information from EIGEN-6C) and modified processing standards (e.g. for accelerometer data parameterization or GPS data processing). Two first test years of RL05 solutions already indicated both notable noise reduction and signal improvement compared to its precursor RL04. Based on a longer time-series, we will present the final RL05 validation. Also, since in the later mission phase (starting end of 2010) the GRACE accelerometers have to be turned off approx. every 5 months due to on-board battery problems, an alternative processing method using models instead of accelerometer data is examined in order to provide an uninterrupted time series.},

abstract = {Aimed at mapping time variations in the Earth�s gravity field, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission is applicable to access terrestrial water storage (TWS), which mainly includes groundwater, soil moisture (SM), and snow. In this study, SM and accumulated snow water equivalent (SWE) are simulated by the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) land surface models (LSMs) and then used to isolate groundwater anomalies from GRACE-derived TWS in Pennsylvania and New York States of the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The monitoring well water-level records from the U.S. Geological Survey Ground-Water Climate Response Network from January 2005 to December 2011 are used for validation. The groundwater results from different combinations of GRACE products (from three institutions, CSR, GFZ and JPL) and GLDAS LSMs (CLM, NOAH and VIC) are compared and evaluated with in-situ measurements. The intercomparison analysis shows that the solution obtained through removing averaged simulated SM and SWE of the three LSMs from the averaged GRACE-derived TWS of the three centers would be the most robust to reduce the noises, and increase the confidence consequently. Although discrepancy exists, the GRACE-GLDAS estimated groundwater variations generally agree with in-situ observations. For monthly scales, their correlation coefficient reaches 0.70 at 95% confidence level with the RMSE of the differences of 2.6 cm. Two-tailed Mann-Kendall trend test results show that there is no significant groundwater gain or loss in this region over the study period. The GRACE time-variable field solutions and GLDAS simulations provide precise and reliable data sets in illustrating the regional groundwater storage variations, and the application will be meaningful and invaluable when applied to the data-poor regions.},

The analysis focused on the secular changes\nover a 4-year period spanning from 2003 to 2007, using the recently\nreprocessed and publicly available data sets for both missions. The\nresults show that the two independent data sets possess strong spatial\ncorrelations, but that there are several factors that can significantly\nimpact the total derived ice mass variability from both missions.\nFor GRACE, the primary source of uncertainty comes from the modelling\nof glacial isostatic adjustment, along with the estimates of C-2,C-0\nand the degree one terms. For ICESat, it is shown that assumptions\nabout firn density, rate biases, and the sampling interval of the\nvarious laser campaigns can have large effects on the results. Despite\nthese uncertainties, the similarities that do exist indicate a strong\npotential for the future refinement of both GIA and mass balance\nestimates of Antarctica.},

abstract = {Different types of GPS clock and orbit data provided by the International GPS Service (IGS) have been used to assess the accuracy of rapid orbit determination for satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) using spaceborne GPS measurements. To avoid the need for reference measurements from ground-based reference receivers, the analysis is based on an undifferenced processing of GPS code and carrier-phase measurements. Special attention is therefore given to the quality of GPS clock data that directly affects the resulting orbit determination accuracy. Interpolation of clock data from the available 15 min grid points is identified as a limiting factor in the use of IGS ultra-rapid ephemerides. Despite this restriction, a 10-cm orbit determination accuracy can be obtained with these products data as demonstrated for the GRACE-B spacecraft during selected data arcs between 2002 and 2004. This performance may be compared with a 5-cm orbit determination accuracy achievable with IGS rapid and final products using 5 min clock samples. For improved accuracy, high-rate (30 s) clock solutions are recommended that are presently only available from individual IGS centers. Likewise, a reduced latency and more frequent updates of IGS ultra-rapid ephemerides are desirable to meet the requirements of upcoming satellite missions for near real-time and precise orbit determination.},

abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are always available, globally, and the signal structures are well known, except for those dedicated to military use. They also have some distinctive characteristics, including the use of L-band frequencies, which are particularly suited for remote sensing purposes. The idea of using GNSS signals for remote sensing - the atmosphere, oceans or Earth surface - was first proposed more than two decades ago. Since then, GNSS remote sensing has been intensively investigated in terms of proof of concept studies, signal processing methodologies, theory and algorithm development, and various satellite-borne, airborne and ground-based experiments. It has been demonstrated that GNSS remote sensing can be used as an alternative passive remote sensing technology. Space agencies such as NASA, NOAA, EUMETSAT and ESA have already funded, or will fund in the future, a number of projects/missions which focus on a variety of GNSS remote sensing applications. It is envisaged that GNSS remote sensing can be either exploited to perform remote sensing tasks on an independent basis or combined with other techniques to address more complex applications. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art of this relatively new and, in some respects, underutilised remote sensing technique. Also addressed are relevant challenging issues associated with GNSS remote sensing services and the performance enhancement of GNSS remote sensing to accurately and reliably retrieve a range of geophysical parameters.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the sensitivity of ITRF2008-based satellite laser ranging (SLR) station positions estimated weekly using LAGEOS-1/2 data from 1993 to 2012 to non-tidal time-varying gravity (TVG). Two primary methods for modeling TVG from degree-2 are employed. The operational approach applies an annual GRACE-derived field, and IERS recommended linear rates for five coefficients. The experimental approach uses low-order/degree \n\n\(4\times 4\)\n\ncoefficients estimated weekly from SLR and DORIS processing of up to 11 satellites (tvg4x4). This study shows that the LAGEOS-1/2 orbits and the weekly station solutions are sensitive to more detailed modeling of TVG than prescribed in the current IERS standards. Over 1993–2012 tvg4x4 improves SLR residuals by 18 % and shows 10 % RMS improvement in station stability. Tests suggest that the improved stability of the tvg4x4 POD solution frame may help clarify geophysical signals present in the estimated station position time series. The signals include linear and seasonal station motion, and motion of the TRF origin, particularly in Z. The effect on both POD and the station solutions becomes increasingly evident starting in 2006. Over 2008–2012, the tvg4x4 series improves SLR residuals by 29 %. Use of the GRGS RL02\n\n\(50\times 50\)\n\nseries shows similar improvement in POD. Using tvg4x4, secular changes in the TRF origin Z component double over the last decade and although not conclusive, it is consistent with increased geocenter rate expected due to continental ice melt. The test results indicate that accurate modeling of TVG is necessary for improvement of station position estimation using SLR data.},

abstract = {The European gravity mission GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer), which flew between 2009 and 2013 with extraordinary success, was the result of more than 20. years of system studies and technology developments directed by the European Space Agency (ESA). Already while GOCE was being developed, ESA started preparatory studies for a Next Generation Gravity Mission (NGGM). While GOCE aimed to provide a high resolution static map of the Earth's gravity, the objective of NGGM is long-term monitoring of the time-variable gravity field with high temporal and spatial resolution, by satellite-to-satellite tracking, a technique flown with the US-German mission GRACE for the first time. With respect to GOCE, the new mission implies new measurement techniques and instrumentation, a new mission scenario and different spacecraft design drivers. Despite the differences, however, several achievements of GOCE (e.g. demonstration of long-duration wide-band drag compensation, ultra-sensitive accelerometers, stable non-cryogenic temperature control in low Earth orbit) stand as the basis upon which NGGM is being defined. Technologies and techniques specific of the new mission (laser metrology, multi-task control architectures, high performance propulsion) are undergoing parallel developments in anticipation of the NGGM implementation phase. The paper recalls the GOCE mission and heritage, and introduces the objectives, scenarios, concepts and challenges of the NGGM, highlighting commonalities and differences between the two missions.},

The terrestrial water storage changes, detected as gravity changes by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, are mainly caused by precipitation, evapotranspiration, river transportation and downward infiltration processes. In this study, a land data assimilation system LDAS-G was developed to assimilate the GRACE terrestrial water storage (TWS) data into the Community Land Model (CLM3.5) using the POD-based ensemble four-dimensional variational assimilation method PODEn4DVar, disaggregating the GRACE large-scale terrestrial water storage changes vertically and in time, and placing constraints on the simulation of vertical hydrological variables to improve land surface hydrological simulations. The ideal experiments conducted at a single point and assimilation experiments carried out over China by the LDAS-G data assimilation system showed that the system developed in this study improved the simulation of land surface hydrological variables, indicating the potential of GRACE data assimilation in large-scale land surface hydrological research and applications.},

The receiver is based on ESA's AGGA-2 correlator chip, which implements a high-quality tracking scheme for semi-codeless P(Y) code tracking on the L1 and L2 frequency. Data collected with the zenith antenna on MetOp-A have been used to perform an in-flight characterization of the GRAS instrument with focus on the tracking and navigation performance. Besides an assessment of the receiver noise and systematic measurement errors, the study addresses the precise orbit determination accuracy achievable with the GRAS receiver. A consistency on the 5 cm level is demonstrated for reduced dynamics orbit solutions computed independently by four different agencies and software packages. With purely kinematic solutions, 10 cm accuracy is obtained. As a part of the analysis, an empirical antenna offset correction and preliminary phase center correction map are derived, which notably reduce the carrier phase residuals and improve the consistency of kinematic orbit determination results.},

abstract = {An approach based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been applied on a combination of monthly GRACE satellite solutions computed from official providers (CSR, JPL and GFZ), to separate useful geophysical signals from important striping undulations. We pre-filtered the raw GRACE Level-2 solutions using Gaussian filters of 300, 400, 500-km of radius to verify the non-Gaussianity condition which is necessary to apply the ICA. This linear inverse approach ensures to separate components of the observed gravity field which are statistically independent. The most energetic component found by ICA corresponds mainly to the contribution of continental water mass change. Series of ICA-estimated global maps of continental water storage have been produced over 08/2002-07/2009. Our ICA estimates were compared with the solutions obtained using other post-processing of GRACE Level-2 data, such as destriping and Gaussian filtering, at global and basin scales. Besides, they have been validated with in situ measurements in the Murray-Darling Basin. Our computed ICA grids are consistent with the different approaches. Moreover, the ICA-derived time series of water masses showed less north-south spurious gravity signals and improved filtering of unrealistic hydrological features at the basin-scale compared with solutions obtained using other filtering methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The exceptional situation of getting simultaneous and complementary observations from a mul- tiple of geo-scientific and environmental near-Earth orbiting satellites opens the unique oppor- tunity to contribute significantly to the understanding of global Earth dynamics. This will enable to quantify processes in the geosphere and the interactions with the atmosphere and the hydro- sphere and to predict future developments. A consequence of this research is, on the one hand, to contribute to a deeper knowledge of the Earth system, and on the other hand, the possibility to contribute to the development of sustainable strategies to safeguard the human habitat for future generations. The key parameters that are provided globally are of physical and geometric nature and allow, when combined, an enhanced modelling of the mass distribution and mass transport within the Earth, at the Earth's surface and its envelope. The knowledge of the Earth's mass distribution and redistribution is of crucial importance for the exploration of geodynamic convective and climato- logically driven processes within Earth system. The temporal scales addressed by these processes range from sub-seasonal and interannual to decadal and secular variations on a global to regional spatial scale according to the satellites' data resolution capability. The overall goal of the multi-disciplinary effort outlined in this document is a breakthrough in the understanding and modelling of geodynamics, ocean circulation and sea level, ice mass balance, and the global hydrologic water cycle as well as the mutual coupling of these processes consti- tutive to the highly dynamic Earth system. The challenges will be the identification and separa- tion of the relevant signals in the satellite and complementary data products, signal analyses and model assimilation, and interdisciplinary model integration to achieve a consistent representation of the changing Earth. The present document emphasizes the need for a coordinated national research program on mass transport and mass distribution in the Earth system in view of the considerable German scientific and financial support during promotion, preparation and realization of the satellite mis- sions. Such a program is an adequate way to fully exploit satellite missions' products in order to harvest the scientific return and to keep the leading role of German scientists within the interna- tional scientific and application community as far as kinematical, dynamic and climatologic Earth system processes are concerned. 1},

abstract = {The northern Indian Ocean consists of older Bay of Bengal (BOB) oceanic lithosphere with numerous intra-plate loads; whereas, contrasting elements like active Mid-Ocean ridge divergence and slow spreading ridges are present in the relatively younger (<60 Ma) Arabian Sea oceanic lithosphere. The mechanism of lithospheric cooling of young age oceanic lithosphere from the moderately active and slow spreading Carlsberg Ridge is analysed by considering the hypothesis of near lithospheric convective action or whole upper mantle convection. We addressed these issues by studying the marine geoid at different spatial wavelengths and retrieved and compared their lithospheric cooling signatures, plate spreading and distribution of mass and heat anomalies along with seismicity, bathymetry, gravity and isochron age data. Results show that progressive cooling of young-aged oceanic lithosphere from the Mid- Ocean Carlsberg Ridge is because of conductive cooling and those signals are retrieved in the shorter wavelength band (111 <$\lambda$< 1900 km) of constrained residual geoid with mass anomaly sources near to sublithospheric. This shows steadiness in the geoid anomaly decay rate (∼–0.1 m/Ma), consistency in the growth of thermal boundary layer and progressive fall of basal temperature and heat flux (900– 300 K and 100–18 mW m−2) with increase of lithospheric age. The above observations are attributed to the fact that the advective–convective action beneath the Mid-Ocean Carlsberg Ridge is driven by the basal temperature gradient between the lithosphere and the near lithospheric low viscose thin layer. But, for the case of old-aged oceanic lithosphere in the BOB, the residual geoid anomaly cooling signals are not prominently seen in the same band as that of the Arabian Sea because of the Ninetyeast Ridge magmatism. However, its cooling anomaly signatures are retrieved at relatively higher band (1335 ≤$\lambda$ ≤ 3081 km) having erratic geoid decay rates (–0.3 to 0.2 m/Ma) owing to vigorous convective thermal instabilities originated around 290–530 km from the plume remnant in the upper mantle (for the case of the BOB). We discussed that such instabilities had transported sufficient heat energy to accelerate the erstwhile fast movement of the Indian Plate prior to the India–Eurasia continent–continent collision.},

abstract = {Interannual variability of precipitation can influence components of the hydrological budget, affecting them directly and indirectly through adjustments in vegetation structure and function. We investi- gate the effects of fluctuations of annual precipitation on ecohydrological dynamics. Specifically, we use the advanced weather generator, AWE-GEN, to simulate 200 years of hourly meteorological forcing obtained by imposing four types of precipitation annual process with identical long-term mean. The generated time series force a mechanistic ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. Simulations with perturbed precipitation variability are performed for four locations characterized by different vegetation cover and climate. The results indicate that long-term transpiration (T) and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes as well as vegetation pro- ductivity expressed as Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) are essentially unaffected by the imposed climate fluctuations. This finding supports the hypothesis of a rel- ative insensitivity, except for water-limited environments, of interannual evapotranspiration and vegetation productivity to annual climatic fluctuations, which are mostly reflected in the fluxes of deep leakage and runoff. The occurrence of short periods of favorable meteorological conditions randomly taking place within the year was found to be a better explanatory variable for interannual variability of ET and ANPP than aver- age annual or growing season conditions. The results indicated that local, single-site sensitivities are consid- erably smaller than those observed across climatic and vegetation spatial gradients and thus an important role of ecosystem reorganization in modifying ANPP and ET sensitivity in a changing climate is recognized.},

abstract = {Time series are very common in many fields of science as well as in, for example, economics. Nowadays time series are a more common way of expressing data because of the wide range of sensors and equipments collecting ordered data, such as stock prices and wind speed. Desire for a time series analysis usually rises from a wish to both understand a time-related data and interpolate missing values. In this research we had two different time series and two different aims for the analyze. The first goal was to analyze one-dimensional time series of temperature measurements and try to fill in a self-created gap in the time series. Missing values are commonly present in a real life measurement data, often caused by a failure of a measurement device or a simple human error. The missing values are problematic when analyzing time series: some of the common analyzing methods are not applicable to a data containing gaps and even a small, unfilled gap reduces the reliability of the observation analysis such as future value predictions. The second aim was to work with a selection of satellite image data. These satellite images were all taken from the same location and together they formed a two-dimensional time series. The goal was to analyze the time series of images, aiming to find some common features between different land types and by using these features divide the image pixels into five different clusters, depending on the land types the pixels were representing. The motivation behind such analysis was to test feature recognition possibilities for the recently collected satellite image data, which was measured using the synthetic aperture radar imaging. The data was provided by the Electric Brain project. For analyzing the time series we used techniques based on Fourier analysis, wavelet analysis, cross- correlation and k-means clustering algorithm. As the results presented in the chapter 3 present, the gap filling for the one-dimensional temperature data was performed successfully with two dif- ferent approaches based on Fourier and wavelet analysis. Especially the wavelet analysis approach performed a very good reconstruction for a missing year of temperatures using data from two to five surrounding years. The results of the feature recognition of the two-dimensional satellite image data were not as successful and results did not offer a good land type based separation of the pixels.},

This approach uses the dynamical orbit anal-ysis of GRACE Level 1 measurements, and specially accu-rate along-track K-band range rate (KBRR) residuals with a 1 µm s −1 level of errors, to estimate the total water mass over continental regions. The advantages of regional solutions are a significant reduction of GRACE aliasing errors (i.e. north– south stripes) providing a more accurate estimation of water mass balance for hydrological applications. In this paper, the validation of these regional solutions over Australia is pre-sented, as well as their ability to describe water mass change as a response of climate forcings such as El Ni{\~{n}}o. Princi-pal component analysis of GRACE-derived total water stor-age (TWS) maps shows spatial and temporal patterns that are consistent with independent data sets (e.g. rainfall, cli-mate index and in situ observations). Regional TWS maps show higher spatial correlations with in situ water table mea-surements over Murray–Darling drainage basin (80–90 %), and they offer a better localization of hydrological structures than classical GRACE global solutions (i.e. Level 2 Groupe de Recherche en G{\'{e}}od{\'{e}}sie Spatiale (GRGS)) products and 400 km independent component analysis solutions as a lin-ear combination of GRACE solutions provided by different centers.},

abstract = {This study aims at improving the so-called atmospheric de-aliasing products, which are essential in the process of deriving gravity solutions from GRACE. We develop a numerically and physically improved three-dimensional integration approach. In order to reveal seasonal and long-term hydrological and oceanographic signals, a careful reduction of high-frequency atmospheric mass contributions from satellite gravimetry observations is essential. To this end, it is common to extract meteorological parameters from atmospheric models and convert them to gravity spherical harmonics, known as atmospheric de-aliasing products. This conversion uses a three-dimensional integration approach that involves various approximations. Yet, in the light of the next generation of gravity missions, any of these approximations may pose a limitation for exploiting the full accuracy of the measuring systems. Therefore, in this study the effects of geometrical, numerical and physical approximations for computing the atmospheric de-aliasing products are revisited. Moreover, the influence of different mean atmospheric fields is investigated. Numerical investigations for the period of 2001 to 2009 were performed using atmospheric models from the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and the ERA-Interim reanalysis. To study the impact of uncertainties of each atmospheric parameter on the de-aliasing products, IFS conventional errors and the difference of the IFS and ERA-Interim data sets were propagated. We suggest a method for computing atmospheric de-aliasing products, which involves a more realistic parameterization of the Earth within a numerically and physically improved three-dimensional approach. Our results show that a non-negligible difference between the suggested new method and the current approach of the GeoForschungsZentrum, Potsdam, exists up to degree 13 with respect to the sensitivity of GRACE, and up to degree 50 with respect to the sensitivity of a future Bender-type satellite configuration equipped with a laser interferometer.

abstract = {The time-variable terrestrial water storage (TWS) products from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) have been increasingly used in recent years to improve the simulation of hydrological models by applying data assimilation techniques. In this study, for the first time, we assess the performance of the most popular data assimilation sequential techniques for integrating GRACE TWS into the World-Wide Water Resources Assessment (W3RA) model. We implement and test stochastic and deterministic ensemble-based Kalman filters (EnKF), as well as Particle filters (PF) using two different resampling approaches of Multinomial Resampling and Systematic Resampling. These choices provide various opportunities for weighting observations and model simulations during the assimilation and also accounting for error distributions. Particularly, the deterministic EnKF is tested to avoid perturbing observations before assimilation (that is the case in an ordinary EnKF). Gaussian-based random updates in the EnKF approaches likely do not fully represent the statistical properties of the model simulations and TWS observations. Therefore, the fully non-Gaussian PF is also applied to estimate more realistic updates. Monthly GRACE TWS are assimilated into W3RA covering the entire Australia. To evaluate the filters performances and analyze their impact on model simulations, their estimates are validated by independent in-situ measurements. Our results indicate that all implemented filters improve the estimation of water storage simulations of W3RA. The best results are obtained using two versions of deterministic EnKF, i.e. the Square Root Analysis (SQRA) scheme and the Ensemble Square Root Filter (EnSRF), respectively improving the model groundwater estimations errors by 34% and 31% compared to a model run without assimilation. Applying the PF along with Systematic Resampling successfully decreases the model estimation error by 23%.},

abstract = {In gravity field modeling, fused models that utilize satellite, airborne and terrestrial gravity observations are often employed to deal with erroneous terrestrially derived gravity datasets. These terrestrial datasets may suffer from long-wavelength systematic errors and inhomogeneous data coverage, which are not prevalent in airborne and satellite datasets. Airborne gravity acquisition plays an essential role in gravity field modeling, providing valuable information of the Earth's gravity field at medium and short wavelengths. Thus, assessing the impact of airborne gravity data to fused gravity field models is important for identifying problematic regions. Six study regions that represent different gravity field variability and terrestrial data point-density characteristics are investigated to quantify the impact of airborne gravity data to fused gravity field models. The numerical assessments of these representative regions resulted in predictions of airborne gravity impact for individual states and provinces in the USA and Canada, respectively. Prediction results indicate that, depending on the terrestrial data point-density and gravity field variability, the expected impact of airborne gravity can reach up to 3mGal (in terms of standard deviation) in Canada and Alaska (over areas of 1 {$}{$}^{{}{\}circ {}}{\},{\}times {\}, {$}{$} ∘ {\texttimes} 1 {$}{$}^{{}{\}circ {}}){$}{$} ∘ ) . However, in the mainland US region, small changes are expected (0.2--0.4 mGal over areas of 1 {$}{$}^{{}{\}circ {}}{\},{\}times {\}, {$}{$} ∘ {\texttimes} 1 {$}{$}^{{}{\}circ {}}){$}{$} ∘ ) due to the availability of high spatial resolution terrestrial data. These results can serve as a guideline for setting airborne gravity data acquisition priorities and for improving future planning of airborne gravity surveys.},

The aim of this work is to test a fuzzy-logic method with an enhanced probability function as a tool to provide a reliable criteria for weighting scheme for satellite-laser-ranging (SLR) station observations, seeking to optimize their contribution to the precise orbit determination (POD) problem. The data regarding the stations were provided by the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS), NASA/Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS) provided the satellite data for testing the method. The software for processing the data is GEODYN II provided by NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Factors to be considered in the fuzzy-logic clustering are: the total number of LAGEOS passes during the past 12 months, the stability measure of short- and long-term biases, the percentage of LAGEOS normal points that were accepted in CSR weekly LAGEOS analysis, and the RMS uncertainty of the station coordinates. A fuzzy-logic statistical method allows classifying the stations through a clear 'degree of belonging' to each station group. This degree of belonging translates into a suitable weight to be assigned to each station in the global solution. The first tests carried out showed improvements in the RMS of the global POD solution as well as individual stations, to within a few millimeters. We expect further work would lead to further improvements. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Assessment of the long term mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and thus the determination of its contribution to sea level rise, requires an understanding of interannual variability and associated causal mechanisms. We performed a combined analysis of surface-mass and elevation changes using data from the GRACE and Envisat satellite missions, respectively. Using empirical orthogonal functions and singular value decompositions of each data set, we find a quasi 4.7-yr periodic signal between 08/2002 and 10/2010 that accounts for $\sim$15-30% of the time variability of the filtered and detrended surface-mass and elevation data. Computation of the density of this variable mass load corresponds to snow or uncompacted firn. Changes reach maximum amplitude within the first 100 km from the coast where it contributes up to 30-35% of the annual rate of accumulation. Extending the analysis to 09/2014 using surface-mass changes only, we have found anomalies with a periodicity of about 4-6 yrs that circle the AIS in about 9-10 yrs. These properties connect the observed anomalies to the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW) which is known to affect several key climate variables, including precipitation. It suggests that variability in the surface-mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet may also be modulated by the ACW.},

abstract = {We investigate the bifurcation of artificial halo orbits from the Lyapunov planar family of periodic orbits around the collinear libration points of the circular, spatial, restricted three-body problem. Beside the gravitational forces, our model includes also the effect of the Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) and this motivates the use of the term 'artificial' halo orbits. Indeed, as a typical problem, one may think of a solar sail, which is characterized by a performance parameter measuring the strength of the effect of the SRP on the spacecraft. To settle the model, we determine the position of the collinear points as a function of the mass and performance parameters and the energy values at which Hill's surfaces allow for transit orbits between the primaries. To analyze the dynamics we use a consolidated procedure which consists in the computation of a resonant normal form, allowing the reduction to the center manifold and providing an integrable approximation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system. Finally, we compute the bifurcation thresholds of the 1:1 resonant periodic orbit families (which have the standard 'halo' orbits as their first member) as a function of the performance and mass parameters. The results show that SRP is indeed a relevant ingredient for new dynamical features and must definitely be considered when planning a mission of a solar sail with trajectories in the neighborhoods of collinear points.},

The Galileo IOV (In-Orbit Validation) are the first test satellites of the Galileo constellation and carry satellite laser retroreflectors as part of their payload systems for precision orbit determination and performance assessment. INFN-LNF SCF-Lab (Satellite/lunar/GNSS laser ranging/altimetry and Cube/microsat Characterization Facilities Laboratory) has been performing tests on a sample of the laser array segment under the Thermo-optical vacuum testing of Galileo IOV laser retro-reflectors of Galileo IOV LRA project, as defined in ESA-INFN Contract No. 4000108617/13/NL/PA. We will present the results of FFDP (Far Field Diffraction Pattern) and thermal relaxation times measurements in relevant space conditions of Galileo IOV CCRs (Cube Corner Retroreflectors) provided by ESA-ESTEC. A reference for the performance of laser ranging on Galileo satellites is the FFDP of a retroreflector in its design specifications and a Galileo retroreflector, in air and isothermal conditions, should have a minimum return intensity within the range [0.55??106m2-2.14??106m2] (ESA-INFN, 2013). Measurements, performed in SCF-Lab facility, demonstrated that the 7 Galileo IOV laser retroreflectors under test were compliant with design performance expectations (Porcelli et al., 2015). The kind of tests carried out for this activity are the first performed on spare Galileo IOV hardware, made available after the launch of the four Galileo IOV satellites (2011 and 2012), which were the operational core of the constellation. The characterisation of the retroreflectors against their design requirements is important because LRAs (Laser Retroreflector Arrays) will be flown on all Galileo satellites.},

abstract = {The use of antenna arrays in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) applications is gaining significant attention due to its superior capability to suppress both narrowband and wideband interference. However, the phase distortions resulting from array processing may limit the applicability of these methods for high precision applications using carrier phase based positioning techniques. This paper studies the phase distortions occurring with the adaptive blind beamforming method in which satellite angle of arrival (AoA) information is not employed in the optimization problem. To cater to non-stationary interference scenarios, the array weights of the adaptive beamformer are continuously updated. The effects of these continuous updates on the tracking parameters of a GNSS receiver are analyzed. The second part of this paper focuses on reducing the phase distortions during the blind beamforming process in order to allow the receiver to perform carrier phase based positioning by applying a constraint on the structure of the array configuration and by compensating the array uncertainties. Limitations of the previous methods are studied and a new method is proposed that keeps the simplicity of the blind beamformer structure and, at the same time, reduces tracking degradations while achieving millimetre level positioning accuracy in interference environments. To verify the applicability of the proposed method and analyze the degradations, array signals corresponding to the GPS L1 band are generated using a combination of hardware and software simulators. Furthermore, the amount of degradation and performance of the proposed method under different conditions are evaluated based on Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {The Arctic Oscillation (AO) controls winter climates in the Northern Hemisphere to a large extent. Positive AO brings lower/higher surface temperature and higher/lower precipitation in high/middle latitude regions, and negative AO reverses the situation. In this study, we investigate signals of anomalous precipitations caused by AO using the data of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. Wintertime mass deviations inferred from GRACE in the high and middle (boundary ∼55N) latitude regions in Eurasia showed highly positive and negative correlations with the AO indices. This possibly reflects the northward and southward shift of the centre of winter precipitation during the positive and negative phases of AO, respectively. Wintertime mass deviations also showed positive and negative correlations with the AO indices in the northern and southern parts of Greenland, respectively, but the boundary was further to the north, say ∼75N. AO redistributes the water mass as much as ∼1000 Gt between high and middle latitude regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Such mass redistribution causes significant surface deformation by loading large enough to be observed by Global Positioning System. This also causes the shift of the Earth's rotation axis especially towards the Greenwich Meridian large enough to be detected with space geodetic techniques. AO signatures are also derived from the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, as the first leading mode of GRACE data after excluding seasonal, linear and quadratic components. The EOF analysis also demonstrates that though AO is a main contributor to bring anomalous winter precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere as a whole, in North America, however, influence of the El Ni{\~{n}}o and Southern Oscillation on the winter precipitation anomaly is larger than AO.},

abstract = {The inter-satellite electromagnetic forces generated by the magnetic dipoles on neighboring satellites provide an attractive control actuation alternative for satellite formation flight due to the prominent advantages of no propellant consumption or plume contamination. However, the internal force nature as well as the inherent high nonlinearity and coupling of electromagnetic forces bring unique dynamic characteristics and challenges. This paper investigates the nonlinear translational dynamics, trajectory planning and control of formation reconfiguration actuated by inter-satellite electromagnetic forces. The nonlinear translational dynamic model is derived by utilizing analytical mechanics theory; and analysis on the dynamic characteristics is put forward. Optimal reconfiguration trajectories of electromagnetic force actuated formation are studied by applying optimal control theory and the Gauss pseudospectral method. Considering the high nonlinearity and uncertainty in the dynamic model, an inner-and-outer loop combined control strategy based on feedback linearization theory and adaptive terminal sliding mode control is proposed with finite-time convergence capability and good robust performance. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results are presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed translational model, reconfiguration trajectory optimization approach and control strategy. ?? 2013 IAA.},

abstract = {Swarm, a three-satellite constellation to study the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field and its interactions with the Earth system, is expected to be launched in late 2013. The objective of the Swarm mission is to provide the best ever survey of the geomagnetic field and its temporal evolution, in order to gain new insights into the Earth system by improving our understanding of the Earth's interior and environment. In order to derive advanced models of the geomagnetic field (and other higher-level data products) it is necessary to take explicit advantage of the constellation aspect of Swarm. The Swarm SCARF (Satellite Constellation Application and Research Facility) has been established with the goal of deriving Level-2 products by combination of data from the three satellites, and of the various instruments. The present paper describes the Swarm input data products (Level-1b and auxiliary data) used by SCARF, the various processing chains of SCARF, and the Level-2 output data products determined by SCARF.},

abstract = {The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite, launched on 17 March 2009, is designed to measure the Earth's mean gravity field with unprecedented accuracy at spatial resolutions down to 100 km. The accurate calibration of the gravity gradiometer on-board GOCE is of utmost importance for achieving the mission goals. ESA's baseline method for the calibration uses star sensor and accelerometer data of a dedicated calibration procedure, which is executed every 2 months. In this paper, we describe a method for monitoring the evolution of calibration parameter during that time. The method works with star sensor and accelerometer data and does not require gravity field models, which distinguishes it from other existing methods. We present time series of calibration parameters estimated from GOCE data from 1 November 2009 to 17 May 2010. The time series confirm drifts in the calibration parameters that are present in the results of other methods, including ESA's baseline method. Although these drifts are very small, they degrade the gravity gradients, leading to the conclusion that the calibration parameters of the ESA's baseline method need to be linearly interpolated. Further, we find a correction of -36 × 10 -6 for one calibration parameter (in-line differential scale factor of the cross-track gradiometer arm), which improves the gravity gradient performance. The results are validated by investigating the trace of the calibrated gravity gradients and comparing calibrated gravity gradients with reference gradients computed along the GOCE orbit using the ITG-Grace-2010s gravity field model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Heiligers2014,
abstract = {This paper provides a detailed mission analysis and systems design of a near-term and far-term pole-sitter mission. The pole-sitter concept was previously introduced as a solution to the poor temporal resolution of polar observations from highly inclined, low Earth orbits and the poor high-latitude coverage from geostationary orbit. It considers a spacecraft that is continuously above either the north or south pole and, as such, can provide real-time, continuous and hemispherical coverage of the polar regions. Being on a non-Keplerian orbit, a continuous thrust is required to maintain the pole-sitter position. For this, two different propulsion strategies are proposed, which result in a near-term pole-sitter mission using solar electric propulsion (SEP) and a far-term pole-sitter mission where the SEP thruster is hybridized with a solar sail. For both propulsion strategies, minimum propellant pole-sitter orbits are designed. In order to maximize the spacecraft mass at the start of the operations phase of the mission, the transfer from Earth to the pole-sitter orbit is designed and optimized assuming either a Soyuz or an Ariane 5 launch. The maximized mass upon injection into the pole-sitter orbit is subsequently used in a detailed mass budget analysis that will allow for a trade-off between mission lifetime and payload mass capacity. Also, candidate payloads for a range of applications are investigated. Finally, transfers between north and south pole-sitter orbits are considered to overcome the limitations in observations due to the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis that causes the poles to be alternately situated in darkness. It will be shown that in some cases these transfers allow for propellant savings, enabling a further extension of the pole-sitter mission. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The low-low satellite-to-satellite (SST) tracking mission, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), has the primary science objective of measuring climate-sensitive signals generated by mass redistributions on Earth at spatial scales greater than several hundred km and temporal scales longer than 30 days. Its science data products include 30-day time-series of geopotential models in spherical harmonic coefficients, and the changes in the geopotentials represent observations of the time-variation of the Earth's gravity field. In this contemporary technique, the spectral components representing signals are limited up to a certain degree and order, while the ill-determined higher frequency signals are usually filtered. In this study, we use an alternative method to compute the in situ disturbing potential observations at satellite altitude assuming energy conservation and to determine continental water mass variations with an objective to enhance regional spatial resolution of the signals. In a simulation study using GRACE observable, NCEP daily mean terrestrial water storage data, and realistic atmosphere and ocean tide modeling errors and temporal aliasing, we estimated monthly mean water storage variations for 1 year over South America using both this method and the contemporary global analysis method. We conclude that our method provides more accurate estimates for regional hydrology and with higher spatial resolutions than the contemporary Stokes' approach using global spherical harmonics. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We assess the recent contribution of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) to sea level change. We use the mass budget method, which quantifies ice sheet mass balance (MB) as the difference between surface mass balance (SMB) and solid ice discharge across the grounding line (D). A comparison with independent gravity change observations from GRACE shows good agreement for the overlapping period 2002–2015, giving confidence in the partitioning of recent GrIS mass changes. The estimated 1995 value of D and the 1958–1995 average value of SMB are similar at 411 and 418 Gt yr−1, respectively, suggesting that ice flow in the mid-1990s was well adjusted to the average annual mass input, reminiscent of an ice sheet in approximate balance. Starting in the early to mid-1990s, SMB decreased while D increased, leading to quasi-persistent negative MB. About 60 % of the associated mass loss since 1991 is caused by changes in SMB and the remainder by D. The decrease in SMB is fully driven by an increase in surface melt and subsequent meltwater runoff, which is slightly compensated by a small ( < 3 %) increase in snowfall. The excess runoff originates from low-lying ( < 2000 m a.s.l.) parts of the ice sheet; higher up, increased refreezing prevents runoff of meltwater from occurring, at the expense of increased firn temperatures and depleted pore space. With a 1991–2015 average annual mass loss of ∼ 0.47 ± 0.23 mm sea level equivalent (SLE) and a peak contribution of 1.2 mm SLE in 2012, the GrIS has recently become a major source of global mean sea level rise.},

We investigate the formal contribution of GRACE observations to the Kalman filter update by analysis of the Kalman gain matrix. We then present first model runs, calibrated via data assimilation, for two different experiments: the first one assimilates GRACE basin averages of total water storage and the second one introduces gridded GRACE data at (Formula presented.) resolution into the assimilation. We finally validate the assimilated model by running it in free mode (i.e., without adding any further GRACE information) for a period of 3 years following the assimilation phase and comparing the results to the GRACE observations available for this period.},

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment twin satellites can detect gravity changes induced by large earthquakes, while altimetry satellites and Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis buoys can observe resultant tsunamis. In this study, we introduce a method to connect the oceanic tsunami measurements with the geodetic gravity observations, and apply it to the 2004 Sumatra Mw 9.2 earthquake, the 2010 Maule Mw 8.8 earthquake and the 2011 Tohoku Mw 9.0 earthquake. Our results indicate consistent agreement between these two independent measurements. Since seafloor displacement is still the largest puzzle in assessing tsunami hazards and its formation mechanism, our study demonstrates a new approach to utilizing these two kinds of measurements for better understanding of large earthquakes and tsunamis.},

abstract = {High repetition-rate satellite laser ranging (SLR) offers new possibilities for the post-processing of the range measurements. We analyze 11years of kHz SLR passes of the geodetic satellite Ajisai delivered by Graz SLR station (Austria) in order to improve the accuracy and precision of the principal SLR data product - normal points. The normal points are calculated by three different methods: 1) the range residuals accepted by the standard 2.5 sigma filter, 2) the range residuals accepted by the leading edge filter and 3) the range residuals given by the single corner cube reflector (CCR) panels of Ajisai.A comparison of the statistical parameters of the obtained results shows that the selection of the range measurements from the leading edge of the SLR data distribution allows to minimize the satellite signature effect and to reduce the average single-shot RMS per normal point from 15.44 to 4.85mm. The optical distance between the leading edge mean reflection point and the satellite's center of mass is 1,023mm, RMS=1.7mm.Further, in addition, we utilize the complete attitude model of Ajisai during the post-processing which enables selection of the range measurements to the single CCR panels of the satellite and the formation of the normal points which most closely approximate the physical distance between the ground station and the center of mass of Ajisai. This method eliminates the satellite signature effect from the distribution of the post-fit range residuals and further improves the average single-shot RMS per normal point to 3.05mm. The normal point RMS per pass is reduced from 2.97 to 0.06mm - a value expected for a zero-signature satellite.},

abstract = {A weighted total least-squares (WTLS) approach with linear and quadratic constraints is developed. This method is according to the traditional Lagrange approach to optimize the target function of this problem. The WTLS and constrained total least-squares (CTLS) approach had been distinctively investigated, however, these two problems have not been simultaneously considered yet; furthermore, among the contributions on the CTLS problem, only Schaffrin and Felus considered linear and quadratic constraints together; nevertheless, in many practical examples, some elements of the design/coefficient matrix are fixed and should not be modified and this approach cannot deal with these cases. The main necessity of this research appears after the desirable property of the WTLS approach in preserving the structure of the design matrix was proven by Mahboub. In other words, currently, the WTLS approach is one of the most efficient methods for solving the so-called errors-in-variables model and an attempt for equipping it with constraints seems necessary. Also it is demonstrated that the additional constraints have a 'regularization role' for ill-conditioned problems and the unconstrained solution suffers from ill-conditioning effects which give it an added advantage over the unconstrained WTLS algorithm. Four geodetic applications indicate the significant of this problem in the presence of colored and white noise in the data.},

abstract = {The two GRACE satellites provide the ideal platform to study the performance of different strategies for precise orbit determination using undifferenced or doubly differenced GPS data. We use pseudo-stochastic orbit modeling techniques in a batch least-squares environment for the two GRACE satellites to outline the mutual benefits of processing doubly differenced instead of undifferenced GPS data. We either process the space baseline only, the space-ground baselines only, or both types of baselines together, and show that the fixing of the GPS double difference carrier phase ambiguities has a significant impact on the space baseline, but also on the space-ground baselines. The validation of the relative orbit positions by inter-satellite K-band observations shows precisions of better than 1 mm in the case of fixed space baseline ambiguities, precisions of a few millimeter in the case of fixed space-ground baseline ambiguities, and precisions of about 1 cm in the case of float ambiguities. We discuss the differences between the various GRACE orbit solutions in order to formulate well suited orbit determination strategies tailored to the GRACE configuration. Satellite laser ranging observations indicate that accuracies between 2 cm and 2.5 cm are achieved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).The Swarm satellites were launched on November 22, 2013, and carry accelerometers and GPS receivers as part of their scientific payload. The GPS receivers do not only provide the position and time for the magnetic field measurements, but are also used for determining non-gravitational forces like drag and radiation pressure acting on the spacecraft. The accelerometers measure these forces directly, at much finer resolution than the GPS receivers, from which thermospheric neutral densities can be derived. Unfortunately, the acceleration measurements suffer from a variety of disturbances, the most prominent being slow temperature-induced bias variations and sudden bias changes. In this paper, we describe the new, improved four-stage processing that is applied for transforming the disturbed acceleration measurements into scientifically valuable thermospheric neutral densities. In the first stage, the sudden bias changes in the acceleration measurements are manually removed using a dedicated software tool. The second stage is the calibration of the accelerometer measurements against the non-gravitational accelerations derived from the GPS receiver, which includes the correction for the slow temperature-induced bias variations. The identification of validity periods for calibration and correction parameters is part of the second stage. In the third stage, the calibrated and corrected accelerations are merged with the non-gravitational accelerations derived from the observations of the GPS receiver by a weighted average in the spectral domain, where the weights depend on the frequency. The fourth stage consists of transforming the corrected and calibrated accelerations into thermospheric neutral densities. We present the first results of the processing of Swarm C acceleration measurements from June 2014 to May 2015. We started with Swarm C because its acceleration measurements contain much less disturbances than those of Swarm A and have a higher signal-to-noise ratio than those of Swarm B. The latter is caused by the higher altitude of Swarm B as well as larger noise in the acceleration measurements of Swarm B. We show the results of each processing stage, highlight the difficulties encountered, and comment on the quality of the thermospheric neutral density data set.},

abstract = {The satellite gravity gradiometric data can be used directly to recover the gravity anomaly at sea level using inversion of integral formulas. This approach suffers by the spatial truncation errors of the integrals, but these errors can be reduced by modifying the formulas. It allows us to consider smaller coverage of the satellite data over the region of recovery. In this study, we consider the second-order radial derivative (SORD) of disturbing potential (Trr) and determine the gravity anomaly with a resolution of 1° × 1° at sea level by inverting the statistically modified version of SORD of extended Stokes' formula. Also we investigate the effect of the spatial truncation error on the quality of inversion considering noise of Trr. The numerical investigations show satisfactory results when the area of Trr coverage is the same with that of the gravity anomaly and the integral formula is modified by the biased least-squares modification. The error of recovery will be about 6 mGal after removing the regularization bias in the presence of 1 mE noise in Trr measured on the orbit. {\textcopyright} 2010 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The two LAGEOS satellites, currently the best tracked satellites by the stations of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS), play a significant role in the fields of space geodesy and geophysics as well as in very precise measurements and constraints in fundamental physics. Specifically, for the measurements of tiny relativistic effects it is mandatory to build accurate models for the dynamics of the satellites, in particular concerning their spin evolution and the determination of their temperature distribution and thermal behavior under different physical conditions. Consequently, an accurate knowledge of both the external and internal structure of the laser-ranged satellites, and of their main dynamic parameters to be used within the orbit models, is of crucial importance. In this work we reconstruct information about the structure, the materials used, and the moments of inertia of the two LAGEOS satellites. The moments of inertia of LAGEOS resulted to be (11.42±0.03) kg m2 for the cylindrical symmetry axis and (10.96±0.03) kg m2 for the other two main axes. The analogous quantities for LAGEOS II are (11.45±0.03) kg m2 and (11.00±0.03) kg m2. We also built a 3D-CAD model of the satellites structure which is useful for finite element-based analysis. We tried to solve contradictions and overcome several misunderstanding present in the historical literature of the older LAGEOS, carefully reanalyzing the earlier technical papers. To test the results we obtained, we used our moments of inertia to compute the spin evolution of the two satellites obtaining a good agreement between measured and estimated values for the spin direction and the rotational period. We believe we now have accurate knowledge of the mass, moments of inertia, and composition of both LAGEOS satellites.},

abstract = {Using orbital data far more precise than existed a quarter of a century ago, we have derived values for lumped geopotential harmonic coefficients from the passage of the satellites CHAMP (Challenging Minisatellite Payload) and GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) through particular resonances. Due to orbit decay, CHAMP first passed through the 46/3 resonance (orbit repeating after 46 revolutions over three days) and then, in due course, 77/5, 31/2 and 47/3; indeed it passed through 31/2 three times, following orbit raises to extend the satellite's useful lifetime. The orbit data we used for CHAMP came from the retrospectively computed and highly accurate state vectors, but for GRACE (both satellites) only the routine (less accurate) TLEs (Two-Line mean Elements) have so far been available, being used for 61/4 analysis. Values for the lumped harmonics come from analysis of the large variation in the orbital inclination (and to a lesser degree the nodal right ascension) that they cause. Our main success has been for the 31/2 resonance, including the implicit 62/4, but in all cases our lumped values agree well with values based on the complete CHAMP and GRACE high-degree global gravity models (Eigen-3p and Eigen-Grace02s, respectively), though essentially independent of them. This confirms both the validity of our method and the high quality of the new global models. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Basel. Subcrustal stress induced by mantle convection can be determined by the Earth's gravitational potential. In this study, the spherical harmonic expansion of the simplified Navier–Stokes equation is developed further so satellite gradiometry data (SGD) can be used to determine the subcrustal stress. To do so, we present two methods for producing the stress components or an equivalent function thereof, the so-called S function, from which the stress components can be computed numerically. First, some integral estimators are presented to integrate the SGD and deliver the stress components and/or the S function. Second, integral equations are constructed for inversion of the SGD to the aforementioned quantities. The kernel functions of the integrals of both approaches are plotted and interpreted. The behaviour of the integral kernels is dependent on the signal and noise spectra in the first approach whilst it does not depend on extra information in the second method. It is shown that recovering the stress from the vertical–vertical gradients, using the integral estimators presented, is suitable, but when using the integral equations the vertical–vertical gradients are recommended for recovering the S function and the vertical–horizontal gradients for the stress components. This study is theoretical and numerical results using synthetic or real data are not given.},

abstract = {After about 6 years of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission operation, an unprecedented global data set on the spatio-temporal variations of the Earth's water storage is available. The data allow for a better understanding of the water cycle at the global scale and for large river basins. This review summarizes the experiences that have been made when comparing GRACE data with simulation results of global hydrological models and it points out the prerequisites and perspectives for model improvements by combination with GRACE data. When evaluated qualitatively at the global scale, water storage variations on the continents from GRACE agreed reasonably well with model predictions in terms of their general seasonal dynamics and continental-scale spatial patterns. Differences in amplitudes and phases of water storage dynamics revealed in more detailed analyses were mainly attributed to deficiencies in the meteorological model forcing data, to missing water storage compartments in the model, but also to limitations and errors of the GRACE data. Studies that transformed previously identified model deficiencies into adequate modifications of the model structure or parameters are still rare. Prerequisites for a comprehensive improvement of large-scale hydrological models are in particular the consistency of GRACE observation and model variables in terms of filtering, reliable error estimates, and a full assessment of the water balance. Using improvements in GRACE processing techniques, complementary observation data, multi-model evaluations and advanced methods of multi-objective calibration and data assimilation, considerable progress in large-scale hydrological modelling by integration of GRACE data can be expected.},

abstract = {The aim of our work is to generate Earth's gravity field models from the GPS positions of low Earth orbiters. We will present our inversion method and numerical results based on the real-world data of CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE satellites. The presented inversion method is based on Newton's second law of motion, which relates the observed acceleration of the satellite with the forces acting on it. The vector of the observed acceleration is obtained through a numerical second-derivative filter applied to the time series of the kinematic positions. Forces other than those due to the geopotential are either modelled (lunisolar perturbations, tides) or provided by the onboard measurements (nongravitational perturbations). Then the observation equations are formulated using the gradient of the spherical harmonic expansion of the geopotential. From this linear system the harmonic coefficients are directly obtained. We do not use any a priori gravity field model. Although the basic scheme of the acceleration approach is straightforward, the implementation details play a crucial role in obtaining reasonable results. The numerical derivative of noisy data (here the GPS positions) strongly amplifies the high frequency noise and creates autocorrelation in the observation errors. We successfully solve both of these problems by using the generalized least squares method, which defines a linear transformation of the observation equations. In the transformed variables the errors become uncorrelated, so the ordinary least squares estimation may be used to find the regression parameters with correct estimates of their uncertainties. The digital filter of the second derivative is an approximation to the analytical operation. We will show how different the results might be depending on the particular choice of the parameters defining the filter. Another problem is the correlation of the errors in the GPS positions. Here we use the tools from time series analysis. The systematic behaviour of the sample autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function of the residuals shows that their dependence structure might be represented by the autoregressive model. This indeed appears to be the case, upon applying the estimated autoregressive model, the residuals become uncorrelated and the geopotential harmonic coefficients improve by a factor of 2-3. We applied the presented method to orbits of CHAMP and GRACE covering 7 years (2003-2009) and to two months of GOCE (Nov/Dec 2009). The obtained long-term static gravity field models are of similar or better quality compared to other published solutions. We also tried to extract the time variable gravity signal from the CHAMP and GRACE orbits. Based on the data covering several years, we obtained the average annual continental hydrology signal, where the main geographical areas with important hydrological variations are evident.},

In effect, altimetry-derived GMSL changes results from two contributions: Steric (thermal plus salinity) effects due to sea water density change and ocean mass change due to water exchange with atmosphere and continents. On the other hand, GRACE data over the oceans provide the ocean mass change component only. The paper first discusses the corrections to apply to the GRACE data. Then the steric contribution to the GMSL is estimated using GRACE and T/P data. Comparison with available thermal expansion based on in situ hydrographic data is performed.},

abstract = {We analyze spatiotemporal variations of surface mass anomalies induced by hydrological mass redistributions at the Earth's surface. To this end, we use a suite of global hydrological models as well as products from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. As a novelty we identify dominating periodic patterns that are not restricted to the fundamental annual frequency and its overtones, using a method that combines conventional empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) analysis with a determination of sine waves of arbitrary periods from the principal components. We assess the significance of the derived spectra in view of correlated errors of the GRACE data by means of a Monte Carlo technique. This allows us to create filtered GRACE time series including only the significant terms, which will serve for basin-specific calibration of hydrological models with respect to the dominant periodic water storage variations. The study reveals that besides dominating annual signals, semiannual (found only in a few basins), and also long-periodic waves in the range of 2.1 to 2.5 years contribute to periodic water storage variations. An interpretation and a preliminary explanation of these spectra is included. Comparisons of the spectra obtained from GRACE and global hydrological models exhibit in many river basins a systematic advance of the phases of annual terms of the hydrological models as compared to GRACE in the range of 1 to 6 weeks. This indicates deficiencies of the hydrological models with regard to runoff routing in the river network and/or water retention in lakes and wetlands.},

abstract = {Fumaroles are the surface manifestation of hydrothermal circulation and can be influenced by magmatic, hydrothermal, hydrological and tectonic processes. This study investigates the temporal changes in fumarole temperatures and spatial extent on Aluto, a restless volcano in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), in order to better understand the controls on fluid circulation and the interaction between the magmatic and hydrothermal systems. Thermal infrared (TIR) satellite images, acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) over the period of 2004 to 2016, are used to generate time series of the fumarole temperatures and areas. The thermal anomalies identified in the ASTER images coincide with known fumaroles with temperatures >. 80. °C and are located on or close to fault structures, which provide a pathway for the rising fluids. Most of the fumaroles, including those along the major zone of hydrothermal upwelling, the Artu Jawe Fault Zone, have pixel-integrated temperature variations of only $\sim$. 2. ±. 1.5. °C. The exception are the Bobesa fumaroles located on a hypothesised caldera ring fault which show pixel-integrated temperature changes of up to 9. °C consistent with a delayed response of the hydrothermal system to precipitation. We conclude that fumaroles along major faults are strongly coupled to the magmatic-hydrothermal system and are relatively stable with time, whereas those along shallower structures close to the rift flank are more strongly influenced by seasonal variations in groundwater flow. The use of remote sensing data to monitor the thermal activity of Aluto provides an important contribution towards understanding the behaviour of this actively deforming volcano. This method could be used at other volcanoes around the world for monitoring and geothermal exploration.},

abstract = {Since its launch on March 17th 2009, ESA's GOCE mission continuously provides huge amount of gravity-related data in terms of high sensitive gradiometer measurements together with GOCE high precise orbits and other ancillary data. After only one few months repeat cycle of GOCE mission, the first GOCE gravity models became available to the geodetic community. GOCE data products of Level 1b and level 2 are summarized in the well known ESA GOCE mission documentation. ESA provides these data sets packed in the xml format. This paper deals with the algorithms for reading, extraction and usage of these data sets. Since xml is mainly designed for relatively small data sets, most of the xml parsers use computer memory to copy the data contained in the xml files and then loop over this data in memory and extract the desired information. Applied to GOCE products data size and amount, this means that one needs lot of memory to store this data and also that for single record search loop over all data stored in the memory might be necessary resulting in relatively large CPU time. In this paper we introduce method to extract fast the GOCE level 1b and level 2 data from the xml files. Compared to already available xml parsers and xml parsing libraries, it performs 400 times faster and makes GOCE xml data processing fast and reliable. The program is tailored to GOCE xml data structure and is not a general xml parser. It does not copy the huge xml files into memory but extracts the data from the xml files by fast algorithm taking into consideration the definition of how GOCE products are packed in the xml files from the ESA GOCE documentation. The program performs well for the data defined in the GOCE documentation. However, if ESA decides in the future to add additional data in the xml files, then update of the software is necessary. The GOCEPARSER program is freely available to the GOCE data- users community from the author.},

abstract = {Pure gravity orbit is an orbit removed non-gravity disturbances, which can give a more precise relation between gravity and orbit, and can be used to navigation satellite, earth gravity felid measurement, gravity wave detection and other fundamental physical test mission. In this paper, the author propose a system concept of a new pure gravity orbit acquirement method named inner formation flying system, which treats the PM and the outer satellite as a pair of formation flying satellites. The inner formation flying system consists of an outer satellite and an inner satellite. The outer satellite is a small satellite with a cavity in the center. The inner satellite is a PM flying in the housing of the outer satellites cavity. So the inner satellite is shielded from non-gravitational forces of atmosphere drag and radiation pressure and flies along a purely gravitational path. From the view of formation flying, the outer satellite can be treated as a formation satellite with zero or small distance to the inner reference satellite. So the analysis of mechanic and dynamics of inner formation is made at first. Then a control architecture including feed forward and feedback strategies is presented and the controller is designed. The simulation is carried out in a high precision formation flying simulation environment at last to validate the inner formation flying methods. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Han2008,
abstract = {We present a method to analyze the observations of relative distance change between two low Earth orbiting satellites of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission after removing the effects caused by the mean gravity field and better-known temporal mass redistribution. The gravitational acceleration exerted by the block mean mass within a region on the Earth surface is formulated by point mass approximation and by spherical harmonic expansion. In addition to the regional mass parameters, the arc-dependent parameters (initial relative state vectors) is simultaneously modeled to remove the signals not associated with the mass variation within the focus area. While a certain level of approximation, that is committed when locally formulating the gravitational acceleration vector for numerical integration, causes model error, we benefit from regionally estimating time-variable mass with improved spatial and temporal resolutions. In addition, various temporal parameterizations depending on geographical areas and expected signals can be applied for the regional analysis in a straightforward manner and it helps to retrieve even sub-daily time-variable signals such as tides from many years of GRACE data. We present the results of hydrology and ocean tide recovery in South America, Africa, North America, and Antarctica from the analysis of 3.5 years of GRACE tracking data and compare them with the traditional global harmonic approach. The algorithm development thoroughly described here will be helpful for the science community to exploit fundamental data (range rate) of the GRACE mission in addition to monthly gravity products.},

@article{Woodworth2003,
abstract = {The recently published Third Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have underlined the scientific interest in, and practical importance of past and potential future sea level changes. Space gravity missions will provide major benefits to the understanding of the past, and, thereby, in the prediction of future, sea level changes in many ways. The proposal for the GOCE mission described well the improvements to be expected from improved gravity field and geoid models in oceanography (for example, in the measurement of the time-averaged, or `steady state', ocean surface circulation and better estimation of ocean transports), in geophysics (in the improvement of geodynamic models for vertical land movements), in geodesy (in positioning of tide gauge data into the same reference frame as altimeter data, and in improvement of altimeter satellite orbits), and possibly in glaciology (in improved knowledge of bedrock topography and ice sheet mass fluxes). GRACE will make many important steps towards these `steady state' aims. However, its main purpose is the provision of oceanographic (and hydrological and meteorological) temporally-varying gravity information, and should in effect function as a global `bottom pressure recorder', providing further insight into the 3-D temporal variation of the ocean circulation, and of the global water budget in general. This paper summaries several of these issues, pointing the way towards improved accuracy of prediction of future sea level change.},

The combined set of CHAMP and GRACE profiles shows excellent agreement with meteorological anal- ysis. Almost no refractivity bias is observed between 5 and 30 km, the standard deviation is between 1 and 2% within this altitude interval. The GRACE satellite clock stability is significantly improved in comparison with CHAMP. This al- lows for the application of a zero difference technique for precise analysis of the GRACE occultation data.},

The information available in the papers and technical reports concerning the current tidal system and/or tidal reductions applied to different quantities is either vague or missing. The current paper shows the status of terrestrial gravity and levelling data in Bulgaria with respect to the tidal system. The differences between geopotential numbers and normal heights in mean and zero tidal system are examined. For data source, four levelling lines from the National First Order Levelling Network are used. In addition, a comparison between the calculated normal heights and the official data published in the “Catalogue of the National First Order Levelling Network Benchmarks in European Vertical Reference System 2007” is made. At the end of the paper, proposals for the proper choice of tidal system in the country are given, taking into account future international as well as local precise geodetic applications.},

@article{Arsov2003,
abstract = {In the course of the GOCE satellite mission, the high-low Satellite to Satellite Tracking (SST) observations have to be processed for the determination of the long wave- length part of the Earth's gravity field. This paper deals with the formulation of the high-low SST observation equations, as well as the methods for gravity field recovery from or- bit information. For this purpose, two approaches, i.e. the numerical integration of orbit perturbations, and the evalua- tion of the energy equation based on the Jacobi integral, are presented and discussed. Special concern is given to the nu- merical properties of the corresponding normal equations. In a closed-loop simulation, which is based on a realistic orbit GOCE configuration, these methods are compared and as- sessed. However, herewe process a simplified case assuming that non-conservative forces can be perfectly modelled. As- suming presently achievable accuracies of the Precise Orbit Determination (POD), it turns out that the numerical inte- gration approach is still superior, but the energy integral ap- proach may be an interesting alternative processing strategy in the near future.},

abstract = {For deriving global maps of the Total Electron Content (TEC) from space geodetic techniques usually observations from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are taken. However, the GNSS stations are inhomogeneously distributed, with large gaps particularly over the sea surface. Within this study we create Global Ionosphere Maps (GIM) from GNSS data and additionally introduce satellite altimetry observations, which help to compensate the insufficient GNSS coverage of the oceans. The obtained global maps are in 2 h intervals and daily values of Differential Code Biases (DCB) for all the GNSS satellites and receivers are also estimated. The combination of the data from around 160 GNSS stations and two satellite altimetry missions - Jason-1 and TOPEX/Poseidon - is performed on the normal equation level. The comparison between the integrated ionosphere models and the GNSS-only maps shows a higher accuracy of the combined GIM over the seas. The study aims at improved combined global TEC maps, which should make best use of the advantages of each particular type of data and have higher accuracy and reliability than the results derived by the two methods if treated individually. ?? 2007 COSPAR.},

Also, the GGM based gravity anomaly including the digital elevation model can be used in evaluation and outlier detections schemes of the ground gravity anomaly data. Further, the deflection of vertical and gravity gradients components from the GGMs can be used for different geodetic and geophysical interpretation purposes. However, still a complete and user-friendly software package is not available for universities and geosciences communities.

abstract = {Three empirical ocean tide models are determined from repeat cycles 10 to 78 of the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) altimeter mission. The three models investigate the effects of the satellite orbit ephemeris on the ocean tides determined from T/P altimetry and the effect of extracting the free core nutation resonance in the definition of the diurnal ocean tide admittance. The altimetric data series use the Joint Gravity Model JGM-2 geopotential orbit ephemeris and the preliminary JGM-3 orbit ephemeris computed at the University of Texas, Center for Space Research. The altimetric data from the T/P mission are shown to have the precision necessary to estimate the monthly and fortnightly ocean tides in each bin. Inclusion of existing models of the ocean tides in the polar latitudes not sampled by the altimeter demonstrates the importance of these latitudes on spherical harmonic representations of the ocean tides. The ocean tides are first estimated in bins of size 2.834\\textdegree in longitude by 1\\textdegree in latitude and then smoothed to 1\\textdegree by 1\\textdegree grids within +/-66\\textdegree latitude. The orthotide response formalism of Groves and Reynolds (1975) is used to represent the diurnal and semidiurnal ocean tides, while a constant admittance is assumed across narrow bandwidths around each of the monthly (Mm), fortnightly (Mf), and termensual (Mt) tidal components. Comparisons of the T/P ocean tide models to tide gauge observations indicate their accuracies to be of the order of 2-3 cm. The T/P-derived ocean tide models remove approximately 20 cm2 more of the T/P measured sea surface variance than the Cartwright and Ray (1991) tide model and show a 19 cm2 and 15 cm2 improvement over the Schwiderski (1980a, b) and Cartwright and Ray (1991) tide models, respectively, when compared to tide gauge estimates of the ocean tides.},

abstract = {The gravity field recovery strategy presented here enables the global\nrecovery of the gravity field combined with a regional focus on\ngeographical areas with rough gravity field features in a consistent\nway. The global gravity field is modeled by a series of spherical\nharmonics while the regional gravity field features are represented\nby space localizing base functions of harmonic spline type. The\nphysical model of the orbit analysis technique is based on Newton's\nequation of motion, formulated as a boundary value problem in form\nof an integral equation of Fredholm type. The observation equations\nare established for short arcs of approximately 30 minutes length.\nThe procedure can be applied either globally or regionally to selected\ngeographical regions. For a regional application the coverage with\nshort arcs should be slightly larger than the recovery region itself\nto prevent the solution from geographical truncation effects. A\nproper combination and weighting of the normal equations of every\narc combined with a tailored regularization allows a stable solution\nfor the field parameters. This procedure can be adapted to the roughness\nof the regional gravity field features, the discretization of the\ngravity field and the sampling rate of the observations. A global\ngravity field solution ITG-Champ01E has been derived based on kinematic\norbits covering 360 days from March 2002 to March 2003. Regional\ngravity field solution have been determined for selected regions\nwith rugged gravity field features.},

abstract = {General relativity (GR) predicts that photons are delayed and deflected by the space curvature produced by any mass. The Post-Newtonian (PN) parameter controlling the curva- ture induced by a gravitational field is $\gamma$, with bending and delay effects proportional to ($\gamma$ +1). $\gamma$ = 1 in GR. The most accurate estimation of this PN parameter $\gamma$ =(1+(2.1±2.3)) {\textperiodcentered} 10−5, has been obtained by the NASA mission Cassini [1] exploiting the frequency shift of radio signal during a Superior Solar Conjunction (SSC) in 2002, while the spacecraft was in cruise to Saturn. The crucial element of the experiment was an advanced radio system providing a highly stable multi-frequency radio link in X and Ka band (8.4 and 32.5 GHz), and a nearly complete cancellation of the plasma noise introduced by the solar corona in Doppler measurements. The ESA-JAXA mission BepiColombo to Mercury will improve the Cassini radio instrumentation by enabling the ranging func- tion also in the Ka band radio link used by the Mercury Orbiter Radio science Experiment (MORE). The fully digital architecture of the transponder provides a pseudo-noise modulation of the carrier at 24 Mcps and a two-way range accuracy of 20 cm. Thanks to the simultaneous tracking by means of the standard telecommunication link, both range and range rate observables will be available for new, more accurate tests of GR. This paper reports on the simulations carried out in order to assess the attainable accuracies in the estimation of $\gamma$ during the cruise phase of BepiColombo. In an optimal configuration, an uncertainty of 5{\textperiodcentered}10−6 may be attained. Keywords—Radio},

abstract = {The geopotential coefficients of a number of recent and past models have been examined with the aim of calibrating their formal (or published) errors, principally by direct comparison with the same coefficients of a precise and wholly independent satellite-only reference field determined (in 2010) predominantly from over 7 years of $\mu$/s low-low GRACE inter-satellite range rate observations (ITG-GRACE2010S). In all of these comparisons the reference field used, over specified spectral ranges, has much smaller reported errors than the ones to be calibrated. In particular we find that a recently published field (in 2010) using gravity gradient and position data from ESA's GOCE satellite, GO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R1, has formal errors which are significantly optimistic for the lowest degrees (n) but with increasing realism where the gradiometer gains influence over the position information (15 < n < 120). Other GOCE models do not afford an unbiased error calibration. Validating error calibration with the independent reference model, of two past comprehensive fields (containing both satellite and surface data), confirms that one of them (JGM3, published in 1994, complete to n = 70) reported generally realistic formal errors while another (EGM96, published in 1998, complete to n = 360, tested only for n < 150) had significantly optimistic ones for most n < 100 but with better realism when affected only by the surface information. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The EGM2008 model is nowadays one of the description of the global gravitational field at the highest resolution. It is delivered with two, not fully consistent, sources of information on its error: spherical harmonic coefficient variances and a geographical map of error variances, e.g. in terms of geoid undulation. In the present work, the gravity field information derived from a GOCE satellite-only global model is used to improve the accuracy of EGM2008 model in the low to medium frequencies, especially in areas where no data were available at the time of EGM2008 computation. The key issue is to set up the error covariance matrices of the two models for an optimal least-squares combination: the full error covariance matrix of GOCE spherical harmonic coefficients is approximated by an order-wise block-diagonal matrix, while for EGM2008, the pointwise error variances are taken from the provided geoid error map and the error spatial correlations from the coefficient variances. Due to computational reasons the combination is directly performed in terms of geoid values over a regular grid on local areas. Repeating the combination for overlapping areas all over the world and then performing a harmonic analysis, a new combined model is obtained. It is called GECO and extends up to the EGM2008 maximum degree. Comparisons with other recent combined models, such as EIGEN-6C4, and a local geoid based on new gravity datasets in Antarctica are performed to evaluate its quality. The main conclusion is that the proposed combination, weighting the different input contributions not only on a global basis but also according to some local error information, can perform even better than other more sophisticated combinations in areas where the input global error description is not reliable enough.},

@phdthesis{VanderWal2009,
abstract = {The objective of this thesis is to study the contribution of the monthly satellite gravity data from the GRACE twin-satellite mission to the study of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) in North America. The GRACE data set of monthly global gravity fields improves knowledge of this GIA especially in areas where terrestrial measurements are sparse, such as northern Canada. Specifically, the following questions are researched for the study area of North America: (i) What is the uncertainty in long-term gravity rates estimated from GRACE data? (ii) Which of the global ice models fits best to the GRACE data? iii) Can a rheology which includes a non-linear flow law explain the GRACE observed maximum geoid rate? It is found that straight forward filtering of the trend estimated from GRACE data removes more GIA signal than it removes errors, therefore recommendations are made for tuning an available filter. After filtering, measurement errors are small and can be represented by calibrated standard deviations or by residuals after estimation of a trend in the presence of annual and inter-annual signals. However, changes in continental water storage are a larger than expected error source that can not be mitigated. In addition, large unexplained inter-annual variability exists in the magnitude and in the patterns of the gravity rate estimated from up to 5 years of GRACE data. The presence of two domes in the GRACE-derived gravity rate pattern as reported before occurs for a variety of processing techniques and is a stable result. However, the largest maximum gravity rate is found at the location of the Labrador ice dome instead of at the Keewatin ice dome. As a result, a better fit is obtained with the older ICE-3G and ICE-4G models than the more recent ICE-5Gv1.2 models for all reasonable viscosity profiles and for all amounts of smoothing applied to the GRACE data. This finding should motivate improvement or testing of a future ice model in North America using GRACE data. Laboratory experiments show that linear and non-linear flow laws occur simultaneously in mantle rocks. GIA modelling in this thesis that incorporates this is found to explain historic sea level data almost as well as purely non-linear rheology, and is able to bring the maximum geoid rate in better agreement with the GRACE observed value than purely non-linear rheology. This is an important finding which can bring GIA modeling in better agreement with laboratory measurements for rock deformation. A small delay in the ICE-4G glaciation further improves the fit in geoid rate while keeping a good fit to global historic sea level data. Increasing ice thickness also improves the geoid rate fit, but worsens the fit with sea level data. Thus, it is better to delay the onset of melting than to increase ice thickness when modifying global ice models for an earth model with composite rheology.},

abstract = {The major goal of future gravimetric satellite missions is to determine the time-varying gravity field so that processes of mass transport on the Earth are better understood. The purpose of the paper is to show the dependency of the accuracy of gravity field recovery on the type of formation. It also intends to show that careful selection of the formation is of utmost importance for the accuracy of the recovered gravity field. The formations considered are trailing, pendulum and cart-wheel. Additionally, the combined inversion considering the observations from the trailing and pendulum formations will be produced, thus simulating a formation in the shape of a 'T'. Several noise scenarios are simulated: computational errors (noiseless simulations), sensor noise and noise in the position. The results show that the larger the inter-satellite ranges, the more accurate is the determination of the gravity field. The simulations indicate that there is a lower sensitivity to gravitational features with similar wavelength as the inter-satellite distance of the trailing formation. The pendulum formation reveals the surprising insensitivity to uncertainties in the relative position, while the solutions from other formations are heavily corrupted by it. This report presents preliminary results and serves as a conceptual guideline for future research.},

abstract = {Traditionally, each component of sea level rise (SLR) has been tackled separately, which has often led to inconsistencies between discipline-specific estimates of different parts of the sea level budget. This project aims at producing a physically-based, data-driven solution for the complete coupled land-ocean-solid Earth system that is consistent with a full suite of observations, prior knowledge and fundamental geophysical constraints. For this, we use a Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) that includes fundamental physical principles (such as conservation of mass and volume), as well as characteristic length scales of different processes in both space and time (e.g., Zammit-Mangion et al., 2015). This poster presents the first global solution for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) achieved by combining GPS observations and the ICE-6G GIA forward model. 2.},

abstract = {This paper describes the performance testing done on the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) GPS receiver engineering model (EM) at the University of Texas at Austin Center for Space Research (CSR). The goal of this research was to achieve a better understanding of the performance and accuracy of the ICESat BlackJack EM, and to investigate the presence of previously reported BlackJack anomalies. The on-orbit performance of the receiver was investigated by using a GPS simulator, which is able to simulate the GPS signals of an orbital environment. The accuracy of the receiver observables and the accuracy of the receiver's real-time navigation solution was investigated, as well as the accuracy of the receiver's timing pulse. This research conﬁrms the high quality GPS measurements, navigation solution, and clock steering of the BlackJack receiver. The presence of several previously reported anomalies is also shown, including an anomaly that occurs when the receiver is tracking a satellite that has a high relative acceleration. However, it is noted that many of these problems have been corrected in later versions of the receiver software.},

@article{Wahr2003,
abstract = {The NASA/DLR satellite gravity mission GRACE, launched in March, 2002, will map the Earth's gravity field at scales of a few hundred km and greater, every 30 days for five years. These data can be used to solve for time-variations in the gravity field with unprecedented accuracy and resolution. One of the many scientific problems that can be addressed with these time-variable gravity estimates, is post glacial rebound (PGR): the viscous adjustment of the solid Earth in response to the deglaciation of the Earth's surface following the last ice age. In this paper we examine the expected sensitivity of the GRACE measurements to the PGR signal, and explore the accuracy with which the PGR signal can be separated from other secular gravity signals. We do this by constructing synthetic GRACE data that include contributions from a PGR model as well as from a number of other geophysical processes, and then looking to see how well the PGR model can be recovered from those synthetic data. We conclude that the availability of GRACE data should result in improved estimates of the Earth's viscosity profile.},

@article{LeProvost1998,
abstract = {An upgraded version of the tidal solutions {(FES94.1)} is presented, obtained by assimilating an altimeter-derived data set in the finite element hydrodynamic model, following the representer approach. The assimilated data are drawn from the {CSR2.0} Texas solutions sampled on a 5??? ??? 5??? grid. The assimilation is applied over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. The standard release of the new {FES95.2} solutions is a 0.5??? ??? 0.5??? gridded version of the full finite element solutions. The associated tidal prediction model includes 26 constituents. The eight major constituents are drawn directly from the hydrodynamic model: K1, O1, Q1, M2, S2, N2, K2, and {2N2,} corrected by assimilation except K2 and {2N2.} The other 18 constituents are derived by admittance. Among them are {\^{I}}?2, {\^{I}}?2, L2, T2, M1, P1, J1, and {OO1.} The quality of these solutions is evaluated by reference to a standard sea truth data set of 95 stations. This quality is significantly improved after the assimilation process is applied: the root-sum-square {(RSS)} of the differences between solutions and observations, for the eight major constituents, is reduced from 3.8 cm for {FES94.1} to 2.8 cm for {FES95.2,} i.e., a gain of 1 cm. The performances of the prediction model are evaluated by comparing tidal predictions with observations at 59 sites distributed over the world ocean and by looking at the level of variance of the sea surface variability observed by the {T/P} altimeter at its cross-over track points after tidal correction. These evaluations lead to the same conclusion: this new prediction model performs much better than the one based on {FES94.1,} because of correction of the major constituents by {T/P} data assimilation and because of the increase in the number of constituents from 13 to 26. The tidal predictions are at the level of accuracy of those produced by the best recent {T/P} empirical models.},

abstract = {In order to test gravitation in the Solar System, it is necessary to improve the orbit restitution of interplanetary spacecrafts. The addition of an accelerometer on board is a major step toward this goal because this instrument measures the non-gravitational acceleration of the spacecraft. It must be able to perform measurements at low frequencies with no bias to provide an additional observable of interest. Since electrostatic accelerometers suffer a bias, a technological upgrade has been proposed by Onera. It consists in adding to an electrostatic accelerometer a rotating platform which allows modulating the signal of interest and retrieving it without bias after post-processing. Using this principle, a measurement method and a post-processing method have been developed. The objective of this article is to validate these methods experimentally. To do so, a horizontally controlled pendulum was used to apply a known signal to an accelerometer mounted on a rotating platform. The processing of the experimental data demonstrates the ability to make acceleration measurements with no bias. In addition, the experimental precision on the unbiased acceleration obtained after post-processing corresponds to the precision predicted theoretically.},

abstract = {Sentinel-1A is the first satellite of the European Copernicus programme. Equipped with a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument the satellite was launched on April 3, 2014. Operational since October 2014 the satellite delivers valuable data for more than two years. The orbit accuracy requirements are given as 5 cm in 3D. In order to fulfill this stringent requirement the precise orbit determination (POD) is based on the dual-frequency GPS observations delivered by an eight-channel GPS receiver. The Copernicus POD (CPOD) Service is in charge of providing the orbital and auxiliary products required by the PDGS (Payload Data Ground Segment). External orbit validation is regularly performed by comparing the CPOD Service orbits to orbit solutions provided by POD expert members of the Copernicus POD Quality Working Group (QWG). The orbit comparisons revealed systematic orbit offsets mainly in radial direction (approx. 3 cm). Although no independent observation technique (e.g. DORIS, SLR) is available to validate the GPS-derived orbit solutions, comparisons between the different antenna phase center variations and different reduced-dynamic orbit determination approaches used in the various software packages helped to detect the cause of the systematic offset. An error in the given geometry information about the satellite has been found. After correction of the geometry the orbit validation shows a significant reduction of the radial offset to below 5 mm. The 5 cm orbit accuracy requirement in 3D is fulfilled according to the results of the orbit comparisons between the different orbit solutions from the QWG.},

abstract = {Least-squares (LS) problems occur in almost every scientific and engineering discipline. Basically, they are generated by providing more observations than unknown parameters to be resolved. Appropriate LS solvers depend on both quality and computational issues. With regard to the latter, this paper focuses on the tailored parallel implementation of two LS solvers: the iterative LSQR method (substitutional for any Krylov-space method) and the "brute-force" inversion approach. Both implementations demonstrate very good scaling results in a parallel processing environment. Even so, the present investigations show that, from the computational and hardware point of view, iterative solvers outperform the "brute-force" approach. LSQR not only provides superior speed-up values; but, in addition, source code portability and hardware requirements are much more convenient for the iterative solver. These conclusions are drawn in the context of state-of-the-art terrestrial geopotential recovery with regard to the forthcoming Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite mission. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Pour2013,
abstract = {Drawing on experience from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data analysis, the scientific challenges were already identified in several studies. Any future mission should focus on improvement in both precision and resolution in space and time. For future gravity missions which use high quality sensors, aliasing of high frequency time-variable geophysical signals to the lower frequency signals is one of the most serious problems. The aliasing problem and the spatio-temporal resolution are mainly restricted by two sampling theorems describing the space-time sampling of satellite missions: (i) a Heisenberg-like uncertainty theorem which states that the product of spatial resolution and time resolution is constant, and (ii) the Colombo-Nyquist rule (CNR), which requires the number of satellite revolutions in a repeat period to be at least twice a given maximum spherical harmonic degree. The CNR holds under the assumption of equal ground-track spacing, and limits the spatial resolution of the gravity solution. This study investigates the quality of sub-Nyquist time interval recoveries (when the time intervals are shorter than what is required by the Colombo-Nyquist rule) of different orbit configurations and formation flights, in particular, the dependence of the gravity field accuracy on the measurement duration and ground-track patterns of the satellite formations. It is shown that the fulfillment of the modified CNR, the mission altitude and avoidance of large unobserved gaps by satellite ground-track patterns have the strongest effect on the quality of the recoveries, while the sub-cycle concept does not appear to play an imortant role. It is also found that the modified CNR holds for architectures including two satellite pairs when accounting for the orbital revolutions of both pairs. Moreover, the quality of the solution in the double pair scenario, consisting of a near-polar and an inclined inline pairs, exceeds that of a single near-polar inline pair solution with twice the observations. One important reason is the East-West information of the inclined pair adds to the North-South measurements of the near-polar mission. The simulations of the gravity recoveries of this study are based on a quick-look tool. The tool assumes nominal repeat orbits for satellite missions. Based on the quality assessment of the recoveries and the technical concerns of advanced formation flights as e.g. Pendulum or Cartwheel, a search space for optimal satellite mission scenarios is suggested. {\textcopyright} 2013 COSPAR.

abstract = {Mass change over Greenland can be caused by either changes in the glacial dynamic mass balance (DMB) or the surface mass balance (SMB). The GRACE satellite gravity mission cannot directly separate the two physical causes because it measures the sum of the entire mass column with limited spatial resolution. We demonstrate one theoretical way to indirectly separate cumulative SMB from DMB with GRACE, using a least squares inversion technique with knowledge of the location of the glaciers. However, we find that the limited 60 × 60 spherical harmonic representation of current GRACE data does not provide sufficient resolution to adequately accomplish the task. We determine that at a maximum degree/order of 90 × 90 or above, a noise-free gravity measurement could theoretically separate the SMB from DMB signals. However, current GRACE satellite errors are too large at present to separate the signals. A noise reduction of a factor of 10 at a resolution of 90 × 90 would provide the accuracy needed for the interannual cumulative SMB and DMB to be accurately separated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors 2016. Since 2002 Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provides monthly gravity fields from K-band ranging (KBR) between two GRACE satellites. These KBR gravity monthlies have enabled the global observation of time-varying Earth mass signal at a regional scale (about 400 km resolution). Apart from KBR, monthly gravity solutions can be computed from onboard GPS data. The newly reprocessed GPS monthlies from 13 yr of GRACE data are shown to yield correct time-variable gravity signal (seasonality, trends, interannual variations) at a spatial resolution of 1300 km (harmonic degree 15). We show that GPS fields from new Swarm mission are of similar quality as GRACE GPS monthlies. Thus, Swarm GPS monthlies represent new and independent source of information on time-variable gravity, and, although with lower resolution and accuracy, they can be used for its monitoring, particularly if GRACE KBR/GPS data become unavailable before GRACE Follow-On is launched (2017 August).},

abstract = {This paper deals with the relative navigation of a formation of two spacecrafts separated by hundreds of kilometers based on processing dual-frequency differential carrier-phase GPS measurements. Specific requirements of the considered application are high relative positioning accuracy and real-time on board implementation. These can be conflicting requirements. Indeed, if on one hand high accuracy can be achieved by exploiting the integer nature of double-difference carrier-phase ambiguities, on the other hand the presence of large ephemeris errors and differential ionospheric delays makes the integer ambiguities determination challenging. Closed-loop schemes, which update the relative position estimates of a dynamic filter with feedback from integer ambiguities fixing algorithms, are customarily employed in these cases. This paper further elaborates such approaches, proposing novel closed loop techniques aimed at overcoming some of the limitations of traditional algorithms. They extend techniques developed for spaceborne long baseline relative positioning by making use of an on-the-fly ambiguity resolution technique especially developed for the applications of interest. Such techniques blend together ionospheric delay compensation techniques, nonlinear models of relative spacecraft dynamics, and partial integer validation techniques. The approaches are validated using flight data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Performance is compared to that of the traditional closed-loop scheme analyzing the capability of each scheme to maximize the percentage of correctly fixed integer ambiguities as well as the relative positioning accuracy. Results show that the proposed approach substantially improves performance of the traditional approaches. More specifically, centimeter-level root-mean square relative positioning is feasible for spacecraft separations of more than 260 km, and an integer ambiguity fixing performance as high as 98% is achieved in a 1-day long dataset. Results also show that approaches exploiting ionospheric delay models are more robust and precise of approaches relying on ionospheric-delay removal techniques. ?? 2013 IAA.},

abstract = {The impact of assimilating global ocean bottom pressure (OBP) information from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity anomalies on the circulation estimate was investigated. For this an estimate of the ocean circulation is being inferred by extending the 50-year-long German part of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (GECCO) ocean synthesis into recent years. The assimilation system is an improved version of the previous GECCO optimization, which now includes a sea ice model, has enhanced resolution on a truly global domain including the Arctic Ocean. By analyzing differences to a synthesis that additionally assimilated OBP, the GRACE data was found to provide complementary information to standard ocean data sets including satellite altimetry when assimilated. Although in principle standard ocean data sets include the OBP information, the reason why this cannot be extracted is the much larger prior errors for hydrographic and altimeter data in comparison to OBP data owing to the fact that only the former two need to include the unresolved eddy signal. The largest impact of gravity data is found to be on the barotropic circulation, particularly in the subtropical gyres and the polar latitudes. Remaining differences between the simulated and observed OBP information are associated with meridional stripes in the GRACE gravity maps and with the leakage of terrestrial hydrological information into the ocean. Additional differences close to the continental boundaries are related to the self-attraction and loading, processes that are not included in the models.},

abstract = {The modelling of non-gravitational forces acting on a satellite (especially a GNSS satellite) started half a century ago. Their modelling to low Earth orbiters (LEOs), however, are more recent because of the dominating atmospheric drag, the modelling of which requires the precision of recent atmospheric models. However, this is not an issue for precise orbit determination (POD), as of the method used to compute the reduced-dynamic orbit. The method is using piecewise constant accelerations (PCA), which are absorbing the non-conservative forces that are not modelled. One expects the implementation of non-gravitational forces to reduce the amplitude and mean values of the PCA of the satellite's reduced-dynamic orbit. In this thesis assignment, four non-gravitational forces has been considered large enough for improving the POD of GPS-based LEO using the Bernese GNSS Software: the aerodynamic forces, the solar radiation pressure and the reflected and emitted Earth radiation pressure. For each force, a modelling method has been chosen and implemented in the Bernese GNSS Software. The impact of the modelled non-gravitational forces has been evaluated with Swarm and GRACE LEOs with all the available validation and comparison methods: PCA, accelerometer data, GPS observation fit, satellite laser ranging observations and K/Ka-band ranging measurements. As expected, the implementation of all the forces reduces the standard deviation of the PCA in each direction, for both Swarm C (-8% in radial, -56% in along-track and -22% in cross-track) and GRACE A (-73% in radial, -75% in along-track and -20% in cross-track). Regarding the mean values for Swarm C a large reduction is observed in: along-track (-129%) and cross-track (-97%) direction, but the mean acceleration in radial direction increase by a few percent (7%). For GRACE A, the mean values of the PCA are reduced along each orbital axis (-88% in radial, -112% in along-track and -23% in cross-track). In addition to the PCA reduction, the precision of the reduced-dynamic orbit has also been improved by the modelling of the non-gravitational forces. In terms of values the a posteriori standard deviation of unit weight of 1.96 mm has been reduced to 1.93 mm for Swarm and from 2.3 mm to 1.45 mm for GRACE. Finally, different parameterizations of the aerodynamic forces have been carried out in order to determine the best atmospheric model and gas-surface interaction algorithm for LEO POD improvement. The impact of a horizontal wind model has been tested. More specifically: modelling the gas-surface interaction with Goodman's model using the DTM2013 atmospheric model with the horizontal wind correction HWM14 have shown the best results in LEO POD.},

abstract = {We estimate the mean steric sea level variations over the 60°S-60°N oceanic domain for the recent period (from August 2002 to April 2006), by combining sea level data from Jason-1 altimetry with time-variable gravity data from GRACE. The observed global mean sea level change from satellite altimetry results in total from steric plus ocean mass change. As GRACE measurements averaged over the ocean represents the ocean mass change component only, the difference between GRACE and altimetry observations provides an estimate of the mean steric sea level. Two different sets of GRACE geoid solutions (the GRGS EIGEN-GL04 and the GFZ EIGEN-GRACE04S products) have been used. Each GRACE data set ranges over approximately 3 yr or more (August 2002-April 2006 for the GRGS geoids and February 2003-February 2006 for the GFZ geoids). We first focus on the seasonal variations. The two GRACE data sets agree very well in terms of mean annual mass variation, both in amplitude (approximately 7.3 mm equivalent sea level) and phase (maximum on October 14). For both time spans, Jason-1 sea level minus GRACE ocean mass has an annual amplitude of approximately 5.8 mm with a maximum on March 11. The latter signal compares well with the steric annual sea level estimated from the World Ocean 2004 climatology and the Ishii et al. [M. Ishii, M. Kimoto, K. Sakamoto, and S.I. Iwasaki, Steric sea level changes estimated from historical ocean subsurface temperature and salinity analyses, Journal of Oceanography, 62 (2) (2006) 155-170.] ocean temperature data. We also examine the interannual fluctuations of the Jason-1 minus GRACE sea level. The two resulting steric sea level time series (based on the two GRACE data sets) agree well. The inferred steric sea level curve exhibits an increasing trend during the last 3.5 yr (August 2002-April 2006), of the same order of magnitude as the 1993-2003 steric sea level trend computed with in situ hydrographic data. However, over the last 3.5 yr, we note a strong discrepancy between altimetry minus GRACE and in situ-based steric sea level trend, the latter exhibiting a negative slope. The cause for such a discrepancy is yet unknown but may be related to inadequate sampling of in situ ocean temperature measurements. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {In space surveillance, long-term orbital propagation is often required to track space objects when the measurement updates are scarce. It is a challenging uncertainty propagation problem and can be addressed by many different numerical integration rules, such as the unscented transformation, the Gauss–Hermite quadrature rule, and the cubature rule. The conventional cubature rule and the unscented transformation are only the third-degree numerical rules that may not be precise enough for the long-term uncertainty propagation. The Gauss–Hermite quadrature rule is accurate to arbitrary degrees. However, it suffers the curse-of-dimensionality problem. To balance the computational complexity and accuracy, the high-degree sparse-grid quadrature rule and the high-degree spherical–radial cubature rule have been proposed in recent years. Unfortunately, the weights of these two rules may become negative, which can lead to a negative-definite covariance matrix and degrade the performance of uncertainty propagation. ...},

abstract = {Precision relative navigation is an essential aspect of spacecraft formation flying missions, both from an operational and a scientific point of view. When using GPS as a relative distance sensor, dual-frequency receivers are required for high accuracy at large inter-satellite separations. This allows for a correction of the relative ionospheric path delay and enables double difference integer ambiguity resolution. Although kinematic relative positioning techniques demonstrate promising results for hardware-in-the-loop simulations, they were found to lack an adequate robustness in real-world applications. To overcome this limitation, an extended Kalman Filter modeling the relative spacecraft dynamics has been developed. The filter processes single difference GPS pseudorange and carrier phase observations to estimate the relative position and velocity along with empirical accelerations and carrier phase ambiguities. In parallel, double difference carrier phase ambiguities are resolved on both frequencies using the least square ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA) method in order to fully exploit the inherent measurement accuracy. The combination of reduced dynamic filtering with the LAMBDA method results in smooth relative position estimates as well as fast and reliable ambiguity resolution. The proposed method has been validated with data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) mission. For an 11-day data arc, the resulting solution matches the GRACE K-Band Ranging System measurements with an accuracy of 1 mm, whereby 83% of the double difference ambiguities are resolved.},

@article{Diessongo2014a,
abstract = {The European Galileo system offers one dedicated signal that is superior to all other signals currently available in space, namely the broadband signal E5. This signal has a bandwidth of at least 51 MHz using an AltBOC modulation. It features a code range noise at centimeter level. Additionally, the impact of multipath effects on this signal is significantly lower compared to all other available GNSS signals. These unique features of Galileo E5 drastically improve the precision of code range measurements and hence enable precise single-frequency positioning. Certain scientific and non-scientific applications in the positioning domain could likely benefit from the exploitation of E5 measurements. A positioning approach based on an additive combination of code range and carrier phase measurements (CPC-"code-plus-carrier") to eliminate the ionospheric delay could be used to perform precise positioning over long distances. Unfortunately, this derived observable contains the ambiguity term as an additional unknown what normally requires longer observation windows in order to allow sufficient convergence of the ambiguity parameters. For this reason, a rapid convergence algorithm based on Kalman filtering was implemented in addition to the conventional CPC approach that is also discussed. The CPC-based results yield a positioning precision of 2-5 cm after a convergence time of about 3 h. The rapid convergence filter allows fixing the ambiguity terms within a few minutes, and the obtained position results are at the sub-decimeter level. Regarding one selected test, real data from Galileo experimental satellite GIOVE A were used in order to confirm our assumptions. However, since the current Galileo constellation is not sufficient for real-world positioning trials yet, all major results are based on simulated data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Analysis of satellite laser ranging (SLR) data indicates that the Earth's dynamic oblateness (J\n2) has undergone significant variations during the past 28 years. The dominant signatures in the observed variations in J\n2 are (1) a secular decrease with a rate of approximately &#8722;2.75 � 10&#8722;11 yr&#8722;1, (2) seasonal annual variations with a mean amplitude of 2.9 � 10&#8722;10, (3) significant interannual variations with timescales of 4&#8211;6 years, and (4) a variation with period of &#8764;21 years and an amplitude of &#8764;1.4 � 10&#8722;10 with minimum in December 1988. Two large interannual variations are related to the strong El Ni�o-Southern Oscillation events during the periods of 1986&#8211;1991 and 1996&#8211;2002, and it appears that another interannual cycle may have started in late 2002. The superposition of the decadal variation on the interannual signal makes the J\n2 fluctuation appear to be anomalously large during the 1996&#8211;2002 period. Contemporary models of the mass redistributions in the atmosphere, ocean, and surface water can explain a major part of the 4- to 6-year fluctuations. However, the cause of the decadal variation remains unknown.},

abstract = {Space geodesy applications have mainly been limited to horizontal deformations due to a number of restrictions on the vertical component accuracy. Monitoring vertical land motion is nonetheless of crucial interest in observations of long-term sea level change or postglacial rebound measurements. Here, we present a global vertical velocity field obtained with more than 200 permanent GPS stations, most of them colocated with tide gauges (TGs). We used a state of the art, homogeneous processing strategy to ensure that the reference frame was stable throughout the observation period of almost 10 yr. We associate realistic uncertainties to our vertical rates, taking into account the time-correlation noise in the time-series. The results are compared with two independent geophysical vertical velocity fields: (1) vertical velocity estimates using long-term TG records and (2) postglacial model predictions from the ICE-5G (VM2) adjustment. The quantitative agreement of the GPS vertical velocities with the ‘internal estimates' of vertical displacements using the TG record is very good, with a mean difference of −0.13 ± 1.64 mm yr−1 on more than 100 sites. For 84 per cent of the GPS stations considered, the vertical velocity is confirmed by the TG estimate to within 2 mm yr−1. The overall agreement with the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) model is good, with discrepancy patterns related either to a local misfit of the model or to active tectonics. For 72 per cent of the sites considered, the predictions of the GIA model agree with the GPS results to within two standard deviations. Most of the GPS velocities showing discrepancies with respect to the predictions of the GIA model are, however, consistent with previously published space geodesy results. We, in turn, confirm the value of 1.8 ± 0.5 mm yr−1 for the 20th century average global sea level rise, and conclude that GPS is now a robust tool for vertical land motion monitoring which is accurate at least at 1 mm yr−1.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On mission will use a phase-locked loop to track changes in the phase of an optical signal that has been transmitted hundreds of kilometers between two spacecraft. Beam diffraction significantly reduces the received signal power, making it difficult to track, as the phase-locked loop is more susceptible to cycle slips. The lowest reported weak-light phase locking is at 40 fW with a cycle slip rate of 1 cycle per second. By selecting a phase-locked loop bandwidth that minimized the signal variance due to shot noise and laser phase fluctuations, a 30 fW signal has been tracked with a cycle slip rate less than 0.01 cycles per second. This is tracking at a power 25% lower with a 100-fold improvement in the cycle slip rate. This capability will enable a new class of missions, opening up new opportunities for space-based interferometry.},

abstract = {The GRACE mission, which is scheduled for launch at the end of 2001, will be among the first missions ever to exercise close formation flying for improved science data collection. The joint US-German project aims at the exploration of temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field and the investigation of the Earth's atmosphere. Key payload elements comprise a GPS receiver, a high-precision accelerometer and a star sensor onboard each spacecraft as well as a K-band inter-satellite ranging system. Both spacecraft will fly at a 300-500 altitude with a relative along-track separation of about 22050 km (or 306 secs) to build up a gradiometer that is particularly sensitive to high-order harmonic components in the Earth's gravity field. From an operational point of view, the build-up and control of the formation GRACE poses various new requirements, which have been studied at the mission control center (GSOC): the safe injection of the two spacecraft from the launcher, the control of the semi-major axes of both spacecrafts to maintain the inter-satellite separation within tolerable margins and the accurate maintenance of the line-ofsight pointing of the K-band radar.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on a method of changing the orbit of an asteroid by attaching a solar sail to the asteroid. First, the dynamic model of the tethered system is derived. Legendre pseudospectral method is then used to discretize the system, and the sequence of two quadratic programming is utilized to obtain the optimal control law. Simulation results show that the tethered solar sail can efficiently change the asteroid's orbit. Moreover, the problem of the tether twining around the asteroid caused by the relative orbit motion between the solar sail and the asteroid can be avoided. Finally, the effectiveness of altering an asteroid's orbit by different solar sails is analyzed. Simulation results show that when the area of the solar sail is 106 m2, the asteroid can be deflected at 1.227 ?? 108 m by the solar sail after about 20 years, which is better than the effect of a gravitational tractor.},

abstract = {Incorporating new altimeter data from CryoSat-2 (30 months), Envisat (18 months), and Jason-1 (7 months) satellites into an updated marine gravity field yields significant reduction in noise and improved resolu-tion. Compared to an older gravity field that did not include the new altimeter data, incoherent power is reduced glob-ally by approximately 2.9 dB at 15 km, 1.6 dB at 20 km, and 1.0 dB at 25 km wavelengths. Coherence analyses between the updated gravity and recent multibeam surveys distributed throughout the world's oceans shows an aver-age increase of *0.023 in mean coherence in the 20–160 km waveband, with the biggest increase ([0.08) over fast spreading ridges and smallest (\0.02) over slow spreading ridges and continental shelves. The shortest wavelength at which coherence is above 0.5 decreased globally by *2 km wavelength, with the biggest decrease ([3.5 km) over fast spreading ridges and smallest (\1.5 km) over slow spreading ridges and continental shelves. In the Clipperton fracture zone area these improvements result in seamounts that are more accurately located, the detection of smaller seamounts, and the expression of north–south trending abyssal hill fabric. As more altimeter data from the ongoing satellite missions are incorporated into future gravity field updates, finer-scale details of the seafloor will continue to emerge.},

abstract = {A method of analyzing GRACE satellite-to-satellite ranging data is presented which accentuates signals from diurnal ocean tides and dampens signals from long-period non-tidal phenomena. We form a time series of differences between two independent monthly mean grav-ity solutions, one set computed from range-rate data along strictly ascending arcs and the other set computed from data along descending arcs. The solar and lunisolar diurnal tides having alias periods longer than a few months, such as K 1 , P 1 , and S 1 , present noticeable variations in the monthly ascending and descending 'difference' solutions, while the climate-related signals are largely cancelled. By computing tidal arguments evaluated along the actual GRACE orbits, we decompose and estimate residual tidal signals with respect to our adopted prior model GOT4.7. The adjustment in the tidal height is small yet significant, yielding maximum amplitudes of 4 cm mostly under the Antarctic ice shelves and ∼1 cm in general at spatial scales of several hundred kilometer. More-over, the results suggest there are possible 1-cm errors in the tide model even over oceans well-covered by decades of radar altimetry missions. Independent validation of such small adjustments covering wide areas, however, is difficult, particularly with limited point measurements such as tide gauge.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) processing centers at the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ) and the University of Texas Center for Space Research (UTCSR) provide time series of monthly gravity field solutions covering the period since mission launch in March 2002. Although the achieved accuracy still remains an order of magnitude below the mission's baseline goal, these time series have successfully been used to study terrestrial phenomena such as water storage variations. Over the oceans, the monthly gravity field solutions can be converted into estimates of the fluctuating ocean bottom pressure (OBP), which is the sum of atmospheric and oceanic mass variations. The GRACE products may be validated against in situ OBP observations which are available from a ground truth site in the tropical northwest Atlantic Ocean. Large differences are observed between the in situ and GRACE-derived OBP which are investigated by comparing the tidal and nontidal ocean models used at GFZ and UTCSR for dealiasing short-term (<2 months) mass variations from satellite measurements. Results show that the barotropic nontidal and tide models need improvement at periods shorter than 1 day and longer than 2 weeks. On a global scale the monthly OBP fields from GRACE generally overestimate the variability compared to ocean general circulation models, especially in tropical regions. This may be attributed to continuing deficiencies in GRACE data processing. Nevertheless, there is some initial evidence that GRACE possesses the potential to observe large-scale averages of bottom pressure fluctuations.},

abstract = {Issue Title: Special Issue: Large Scale Visual Media Geo-Localization Modern satellites tag their images with geolocation information using GPS and star tracking systems. Depending on the quality of the geopositioning equipment, errors may range from a few meters to tens of meters on the ground. At the current state of art, there is no established method to automatically correct these errors limiting the large-scale joint utilization of cross-platform satellite images. In this paper, an automatic geolocation correction framework that corrects images from multiple satellites simultaneously is presented. As a result of the proposed correction process, all the images are effectively registered to the same absolute geodetic coordinate frame. The usability and the quality of the correction framework are demonstrated through a 3-D surface reconstruction application. The 3-D surface models given by original satellite geopositioning metadata, and the corrected metadata, are compared. The quality difference is measured through an entropy-based metric applied to the orthographic height maps given by the 3-D surface models. Measuring the absolute accuracy of the framework is harder due to lack of publicly available high-precision ground surveys. However, the geolocation of images of exemplar satellites from different parts of the globe are corrected, and the road networks given by OpenStreetMap are projected onto the images using original and corrected metadata to demonstrate the improved quality of alignment.},

abstract = {The present distribution of intact objects is a good proxy to quantify the catastrophic collision risk and consequences in the coming decades. The results of a large number of long term simulations of the LEO environment perturbed by the collisional fragmentation of massive objects are used to identify the main driving parameters of the long term collisional evolution of the debris population and measure the danger represented by “typical” classes of space objects. An evaluation norm, able to highlight the differences between comparative long term evolution scenarios and to give a quantitative measure of the effects of specific parameters affecting the evolution, is devised. It is shown how, for collisional fragmentations in LEO, due to the highly stochastic evolution of the LEO environment, even the fragmentation of a massive spacecraft might not be able to alter the long term evolution of the LEO population beyond the intrinsic statistical variability associated with the Monte Carlo procedure. Among the parameters determining the long term effects of a collisional fragmentation in LEO, a combination of mass and altitude of the event appears to be the driving factor. In GEO, the situation is different, and the addition of a massive fragmentation lives a signature on the environment that is detectable throughout the investigated time span, with the mass being the only factor important to asses the long term consequences of a collisional fragmentation.},

abstract = {A sliding window technique is used to create daily-sampled Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) solutions with the same background processing as the official CSR RL04 monthly series. By estimating over shorter time spans, more frequent solutions are made using uncorrelated data, allowing for higher frequency resolution in addition to daily sampling. Using these data sets, high-frequency GRACE errors are computed using two different techniques: assuming the GRACE high-frequency signal in a quiet area of the ocean is the true error, and computing the variance of differences between multiple high-frequency GRACE series from different centers. While the signal-to-noise ratios prove to be sufficiently high for confidence at annual and lower frequencies, at frequencies above 3 cycles/year the signal-to-noise ratios in the large hydrological basins looked at here are near 1.0. Comparisons with the GLDAS hydrological model and high frequency GRACE series developed at other centers confirm CSR GRACE RL04's poor ability to accurately and reliably measure hydrological signal above 3–9 cycles/year, due to the low power of the large-scale hydrological signal typical at those frequencies compared to the GRACE errors.},

abstract = {Thermospheric density simultaneously observed by the CHAMP and GRACE satellites in both the pre-dawn and afternoon local time sectors undergoes significant decrease across both hemispheres during the major stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) in January 2009. This decrease is largest in the equatorial region near the subsolar latitude, reaching ∼30% at 325 km, and 45% at 475 km altitude in the afternoon sector. This large density drop demonstrates a substantial cooling of about 50 Kelvin in the equatorial upper thermosphere. Furthermore, the cooling varies clearly with longitude in terms of magnitude and the timing of the maximum cooling. Thermosphere cooling can have important impact on the ionosphere, as indicated by simultaneous plasma observations. Though many questions remain about what causes the cooling, our results open a new perspective for investigating the global coupling of the lower and upper atmosphere during SSWs. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

This earthquake of moment magnitude 8.8 occurred on 27 February 2010 with an epicenter located at 35.85°S, 72.72°W. Data recorded 10–20 days before the main shock along orbits close to the future epicenter show increasing plasma densities. In a second step, a statistical analysis with DEMETER data has been performed using the first 3 months of the years 2007–2010 to monitor density variations in the vicinity of the epicenter at the same local time and seasonal conditions. This study shows that a large increase of the plasma density is very uncommon at this location and at this time and that the increases observed during the days before the main shock could be considered as possible short-term precursors of this powerful earthquake. },

@article{Swenson2003a,
abstract = {1 The satellite Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment GRACE) provides data describing monthly changes in the geoid, which are closely related to changes in vertically integrated terrestrial water storage. Unlike conventional point or gridded hydrologic measurements, such as those from rain gauges, stream gauges, rain radars, and radiometric satellite images, GRACE data are sets of Stokes coefficients in a truncated spherical harmonic expansion of the geoid. Swenson and Wahr 2002 describe techniques for constructing spatial averaging kernels, with which the average change in vertically integrated water storage within a given region can be extracted from a set of Stokes coefficients. This study extends that work by applying averaging kernels to a realistic synthetic GRACE gravity signal derived in part from a large-scale hydrologic model. By comparing the water storage estimates inferred from the synthetic GRACE data with the water storage estimates predicted by the same hydrologic model, we are able to assess the accuracy of the GRACE estimates and to compare the performance of different averaging kernels. We focus specifically on recovering monthly water storage variations within North American river basins. We conclude that GRACE will be capable of estimating monthly changes in water storage to accuracies of better than 1 cm of water thickness for regions having areas of 4.0 . 10(5) km(2) or larger. Accuracies are better for larger regions. The water storage signal of the Mississippi river basin (area = 3.9 . 10(6) km(2)), for example, can be obtained to better than 5 mm. For regional- to global-scale water balance analyses, this result indicates that GRACE will provide a useful, direct measure of seasonal water storage for river-basin water balance analyses; such data are without precedent in hydrologic analysis.},

abstract = {Permafrost-affected soils cover about 40–45 % of Canada. The environment in such areas, especially those located within the discontinuous permafrost zone, has been impacted more than any other by recorded climatic changes. A number of changes, such as surface subsidence and the degradation of frost mounds due to permafrost thawing, have already been observed at many locations. We surveyed three frost mounds (lithalsas) in the subarctic, close to Umiujaq in northern Quebec, using high-precision differential global positioning system (d-GPS) technology during field visits in 2009, 2010 and 2011, thus obtaining detailed information on their responses to the freezing and thawing that occur during the course of the annual temperature cycle. Seasonal pulsations were detected in the frost mounds, and these responses were shown to vary with their state of degradation and the land cover. The most degraded lithalsa showed a maximum amplitude of vertical movement (either up or down) between winter (freezing) and summer (thawing) of 0.19 ± 0.09 m over the study period, while for the least degraded lithalsa this figure was far greater (1.24 ± 0.47 m). Records from areas with little or no vegetation showed far less average vertical movement over the study period (0.17 ± 0.03 m) than those with prostrate shrubs (0.56 ± 0.02 m), suggesting an influence from the land cover. A differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) analysis was also completed over the lithalsas using selected TerraSAR-X images acquired from April to October 2009 and from March to October 2010, with a repeat cycle of 11 days. Interferograms with baselines shorter than 200 m were computed revealing a generally very low interferometric coherence, restricting the quantification of vertical movements of the lithalsas. Vertical surface movements of the order of a few centimeters were recorded in the vicinity of Umiujaq.},

abstract = {Understanding groundwater storage (GWS) changes is vital to the utilization and control of water resources in the Tibetan Plateau. However, well level observations are rare in this big area, and reliable hydrology models including GWS are not available. We use hydro-geodesy to quantitate GWS changes in the Tibetan Plateau and surroundings from 2003 to 2009 using a combined analysis of satellite gravity and satellite altimetry data, hydrology models as well as a model of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Release-5 GRACE gravity data are jointly used in a mascon fitting method to estimate the terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes during the period, from which the hydrology contributions and the GIA effects are effectively deducted to give the estimates of GWS changes for 12 selected regions of interest. The hydrology contributions are carefully calculated from glaciers and lakes by ICESat-1 satellite altimetry data, permafrost degradation by an Active-Layer Depth (ALD) model, soil moisture and snow water equivalent by multiple hydrology models, and the GIA effects are calculated with the new ICE-6G_C (VM5a) model. Taking into account the measurement errors and the variability of the models, the uncertainties are rigorously estimated for the TWS changes, the hydrology contributions (including GWS changes) and the GIA effect. For the first time, we show explicitly separated GWS changes in the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas except for those to the south of the Himalayas. We find increasing trend rates for eight basins: [Formula presented] for the Jinsha River basin, [Formula presented] for the Nujiang-Lancangjiang Rivers Source Region, [Formula presented] for the Yangtze River Source Region, [Formula presented] for the Yellow River Source Region, [Formula presented] for the Qaidam basin, [Formula presented] for the central Qiangtang Nature Reserve, [Formula presented] for the Upper Indus basin and [Formula presented] for the Aksu River basin. All these increasing trends are most likely caused by increased runoff recharges from melt water and/or precipitation in the surroundings. We also find that the administrative actions such as the Chinese Ecological Protection and Construction Project help to store more groundwater in the Three Rivers Source Region, and suggest that seepages from the Endorheic basin to the west of it are a possible source for GWS increase in this region. In addition, our estimates for GWS changes basically confirm previous results along Afghanistan, Pakistan, north India and Bangladesh, and clearly reflect the excessive use of groundwater. Our results will benefit the water resource management in the study area, and are of particular significance for the ecological restoration in the Tibetan Plateau.},

abstract = {The idea of this paper is to refine the terrestrial gravimetric data with the Earth's gravity models (EGMs) and produce a high quality source of gravity data. For this purpose, biased and unbiased integral estimators are presented. These estimators are used to refine gravimetric data over Fennoscandia with the ITG-GRACE2010s and GO_CONS_GCF_2_DIR_R2 EGMs, which are the recent products of the gravity field and climate experiment (GRACE) and the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer (GOCE) satellite missions. Numerical results show that the biased integral estimator has smaller global root mean square error (RMSE) than the unbiased one. Also a simple strategy is presented to down-weight the low-frequencies the terrestrial data in spectral combination. The gravity anomalies, computed by EGM08, are compared to the refined anomalies for evaluation purpose. In the case of using a cap size of 1° for integration the EGM08 gravity anomalies are more correlated with the refined ones. Also the band-limited kernels can simply be generated to maximum degree of the used EGMs for both estimators. Comparisons of the combined anomalies and those of EGM08 show insignificant differences between the biased and unbiased estimators in practice. However, the biased estimator seems to be proper one for gravity data refinement due to its smaller global RMSE. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Klees2008a,
abstract = {We propose a methodology for local gravity field modelling from gravity data using spherical radial basis functions. The methodology comprises two steps: in step 1, gravity data (gravity anomalies and/or gravity disturbances) are used to estimate the disturbing potential using least-squares techniques. The latter is represented as a linear combination of spherical radial basis functions (SRBFs). A data-adaptive strategy is used to select the optimal number, location, and depths of the SRBFs using generalized cross validation. Variance component estimation is used to determine the optimal regularization parameter and to properly weight the different data sets. In the second step, the gravimetric height anomalies are combined with observed differences between global positioning system (GPS) ellipsoidal heights and normal heights. The data combination is written as the solution of a Cauchy boundary-value problem for the Laplace equation. This allows removal of the non-uniqueness of the problem of local gravity field modelling from terrestrial gravity data. At the same time, existing systematic distortions in the gravimetric and geometric height anomalies are also absorbed into the combination. The approach is used to compute a height reference surface for the Netherlands. The solution is compared with NLGEO2004, the official Dutch height reference surface, which has been computed using the same data but a Stokes-based approach with kernel modification and a geometric six-parameter "corrector surface" to fit the gravimetric solution to the GPS-levelling points. A direct comparison of both height reference surfaces shows an RMS difference of 0.6 cm; the maximum difference is 2.1 cm. A test at independent GPS-levelling control points, confirms that our solution is in no way inferior to NLGEO2004.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.This study is focused on the effect of solar flux conditions on the dynamics of gravity waves (GWs) in the thermosphere. Air density and crosswind in situ estimates from the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) accelerometers are analyzed for the whole mission duration. The analysis is performed in the Fourier spectral domain averaging spectral results over periods of 2 months close to solstices. A new GW marker (called C3f) is introduced here to characterize GWs activity under low, medium, and high solar flux conditions, showing a clear solar damping effect on GW activity. Most GW signal is found in a spectral range above 8 mHz in GOCE data, meaning a maximum horizontal wavelength of around 1000 km. The level of GW activity at GOCE altitude is strongly decreasing with increasing solar flux. Furthermore, a shift in the dominant frequency with solar flux conditions has been noted, leading to larger horizontal wavelengths (from 200 to 500 km) during high solar flux conditions. The correlation between air density variability and GW marker allows to identify most of the large-amplitude perturbations below 67° latitudes as due to GWs. The influence of correlated error sources, between air density and crosswinds, is discussed. Consistency of the spectral domain results is verified in the time domain with a global mapping of high-frequency air density perturbations along the GOCE orbit. This analysis shows a clear dependence with geomagnetic latitude with strong perturbations at magnetic poles and an extension to lower latitudes favored by low solar activity conditions. These results are consistent with previous Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) data analysis and with general circulation models.},

abstract = {Amongst various space techniques, GPS-geodesy has proved to be an indispensible tool worldwide for geodynamics and the determination of parameters governing seismotectonics. To study the Indian plate kinematics, an IGS station has been established in September 1995 at NGRI, Hyderabad, India, under the Indo-German collaborative research programme. During the first off-line data transmisssion phase, about one to two days per week of observations were taken. The data analysis has been carried out at the University of Bonn using the Bernese Software version 4.0. The Hyderabad data have been processed together with the data from 8 other selected IGS stations in and around the Indian plate. In our preliminary analysis, which concentrated on the ITRF96 frame-consistent part of the data set, we found the motion of the Indian plate with respect to the Eurasian plate to be significantly smaller than the model rate, i.e. 3.7 cm/y for Hyderabad instead of 4.5 cm/y in the NUVEL-1A plate model. We detected no significant motion between Hyderabad and Bangalore, lying 500 km apart in N-S-direction on the Indian plate.},

abstract = {The upcoming GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission is expected to map Earth's global gravitational field with unprecedented accuracy, especially at the long wavelengths. The measurements are line-of-sight range rates between two co-orbiting, low-altitude satellites that can be transformed into differences of geopotential and horizontal gravitation. One method to attempt the calibration and validation of GRACE data is to compare these in situ measurements using very accurate local terrestrial gravity fields that are upward continued to satellite altitude. This paper presents a rudimentary analysis of the requirements in gravity anomaly data spacing, accuracy, and extent to compute differences in disturbing potential and horizontal gravity disturbance at GRACE altitude. These studies show that to achieve the anticipated in situ accuracy of 0.01 m(2)/s(2) in potential and 0.01 mgal in gravitation the terrestrial spacing and accuracy requirements are rather loose, e.g., 0.5 degrees spacing and 0.25 mgal accuracy. Data extent, on the other hand, is much more important, where caps with radius larger than 10 degrees are required, and then only to validate wavelengths smaller than 1200 km (30-deg reference field). Furthermore, it is shown that terrestrial data requirements are significantly less stringent in the case of computing horizontal gravitation differences at altitude rather than potential differences.},

@article{Palancz2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Geological Society of AustraliaA novel RANSAC robust estimation technique is presented as an effiecient method for solving the seven-parameter datum transformation problem in the presence of outliers. RANSAC method, which is frequently employed in geodesy, has two sensitive features: (i) the user adjusts some parameters of the algorithm, making it subjective and a rather difficult procedure, and (ii) in its shell, a nonlinear system of equation should be solved repeatedly. In this contribution, we suggest an automatic adjustment strategy for the most important parameter, ‘the threshold value', based on the ‘early stopping' principle of the machine-learning technology. Instead of using iterative numerical methods, we propose the use of an algebraic polynomial system developed via a dual-quaternion technique and solved by a non-iterative homotophy method, thereby reducing the computation time considerably. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in three major contributions: (i) the provision for automatically finding the proper error limit parameter for RANSAC method, which has until now been a trial-and-error technique; (ii) employing the algebraic polynomial form of the dual-quaternion solution in the RANSAC shell, thereby accelerating the repeatedly requested solution process; and (iii) avoiding iterations via a heuristic approach of the scaling parameter. To illustrate the proposed method, the transformation parameters of the Western Australian Geodetic Datum (AGD 84) to Geocentric Datum Australia (GDA 94) are computed.},

abstract = {In this paper, the influence of the ground track coverage on the quality of a monthly gravity field solution is investigated for the scenario of a high–low satellite- to-satellite tracking mission. Data from the CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload ( champ ) mission collected in the period April 2002 to February 2004 has been used to recover the gravity field to degree and order 70 on a monthly basis. The quality is primarily restricted by the accuracy of the instruments. Besides, champ passed through a 31/2 repeat mode three times during the period of interest resulting in an insufficient spatial sampling and a degraded solution. Contrary to the rule of thumb by Colombo (The global mapping of gravity with two satellites, Publications on Geodesy, vol 7(3), Netherlands Geodetic Commission, The Netherlands, 263 pp, 1984), see also Wagner (J Geod 80(2): 94–103, 2006), we found that the monthly solutions themselves could be recovered to about degree 30, not 15. In order to improve the monthly gravity solutions, two strategies have been developed: the restriction to a low degree, and the densification of the sampling by the introduction of additional sensitive measurements from contemporaneous satellite missions. The latter method is tested by combining the champ measurements with data from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment ( grace ). Note that the two grace satellites are considered independent here, i.e. no use is made of the K-band ranging data. This way, we are able to almost entirely remove the influence of the ground track leaving the accuracy of the instruments as the primary restriction on the quality of a monthly solution. These findings are especially interesting for the upcoming swarm -mission since it will consist of a similar configuration as the combined champ and ( grace ) missions.},

abstract = {Precise orbit determination is an essential task for analyzing satellite laser ranging (SLR) data. The quality of the satellite orbits directly depends on the background models used for dynamic orbit determination, e.g., on the underlying model of the Earth's gravity field. We investigate the influence of more than ten recent and well known gravity field models on the quality of a combined LAGEOS-1 and LAGEOS-2 orbit determination by analyzing orbital fits. For this purpose we process the SLR data collected by the stations of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) to both LAGEOS satellites in 2008 and show that not only the type and maximum degree of the underlying gravity field model is essential, but also the proper choice of a limited number of empirical orbit parameters that have to be co-estimated with all other relevant parameters like station coordinates, Earth orientation parameters, and the satellite's initial conditions on a weekly basis. Based on the experience gained from such validations, the LAGEOS SLR data collected by the ILRS in 2009 are used to estimate weekly corrections to the C20 values of the underlying a priori gravity field model, and to accumulate the estimates to monthly corrections.},

abstract = {In this work a parametric multi-sensor Bayesian data fusion approach and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for a Change Detection problem. For this purpose two sets of SPOT5-PAN images have been used, which are in turn used for Change Detection Indices (CDIs) calculation. For minimizing radiometric differences, a methodology based on zonal “invariant features” is suggested. The choice of one or the other CDI for a change detection process is a subjective task as each CDI is probably more or less sensitive to certain types of changes. Likewise, this idea might be employed to create and improve a “change map”, which can be accomplished by means of the CDI's informational content. For this purpose, information metrics such as the Shannon Entropy and “Specific Information” have been used to weight the changes and no-changes categories contained in a certain CDI and thus introduced in the Bayesian information fusion algorithm. Furthermore, the parameters of the probability density functions (pdf's) that best fit the involved categories have also been estimated. Conversely, these considerations are not necessary for mapping procedures based on the discriminant functions of a SVM. This work has confirmed the capabilities of probabilistic information fusion procedure under these circumstances.},

abstract = {The aim is to present and to examine an algorithm for the orbit analysis of a low-Earthorbiting GPS-tracked satellite to determine the spherical harmonic coefficients of the Earth's gravitational field. By means of Newton's interpolation scheme the accelerations acting on the satellite are derived from the satellite's GPSpositions x(t k ), y(t k ), z(t k ) or position differences $\Delta$x,(t k-1 k ), $\Delta$y(t k-1 k ), $\Delta$z(t k-1 k ). This is done in a quasiInertial Reference Frame to avoid frame accelerations. The acceleration vector is balanced due to Newton's equation of motion by the gravitational force vector, namely the gradient of the gravitational potential. The coordinates of the gradient of the gravitational potential, which are given in a Cartesian representation, also have to be transformed to the quasi-Inertial Reference Frame. The resulting equation system is then solved by means of a Gauss-Markov model. In order to get a more stable solution for higher resolutions a regularization method (Tikhonov, Kaula) can be applied.},

abstract = {The precise determination of in situ geopotential differences at satellite altitude was demonstrated by simultaneously adjusting the orbits of the coorbiting GRACE satellites with intersatellite low-low range rate measurements. The results agree well (correlation coefficients 0.5{\^{a}}�``0.8) with the monthly solutions of the spherical harmonic coefficients estimated using contemporary methods of precise orbit determination and parameter recovery. Higher correlation (>0.8 in general) was found for the in situ estimates over the continents than over the oceans. The analysis of 4 months of GRACE satellite-to-satellite tracking data from July 2003 to October 2003 indicated a significant migration of mass over the Amazon basin (hydrological effect), which agreed well with the predictions from the published monthly mean global gravity field solutions. Our results demonstrate the validity and utility of this alternative technique for global and especially regional modeling of the gravity field and its variation with temporal and spatial resolutions finer than monthly and 1000 km, respectively.},

@article{Werth2009,
abstract = {Approximately seven years of time-variable gravity data from the satellite mission Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) are available to quantify present-day mass variations on and near the Earth's surface. Mass variations caused by the continental water cycle are the dominant signal component after subtracting contributions from atmosphere and oceans. This makes hydrology a primary area of application of GRACE data. To derive water storage variations at the scale of large river basins, appropriate filter techniques have to be applied to GRACE gravity fields given in a global spherical harmonic representation. A desirable filter technique minimises both GRACE data error and signal leakage across the border of the region of interest. This study evaluates the performance of six widely used filter methods (isotropic filters, anisotropic filters and decorrelation methods) and their parameter values to derive regionally averaged water mass variations from GRACE data. To this end, filtered time series from GRACE for 22 of the world's largest river basins were compared to continental water mass variations from a multimodel mean of three global hydrological models (WGHM, GLDAS and LaD). Filter-induced biases for seasonal amplitudes and phases of water storage variations, as well as satellite and leakage error budgets, were quantified for each river basin and explained in terms of storage variations in and around the basin. The optimum filter types and filter parameters were identified for each basin. The best results were provided by a decorrelation method that uses GRACE orbits for the filter design. Our ranking between all filter types and parameters depended on the geographical location, shape and signal characteristics of the specific river basin. Based on a multicriterial evaluation of satellite and leakage error, as well as an error assessment of the hydrological data, the filter selection and parameter optimisation results were shown to be reliable for 17 river basins. The results serve as a guideline for the optimal filtering of GRACE global spherical harmonic coefficients for hydrological applications.},

abstract = {Accurate quantification of Antarctic ice-sheet mass balance and its contribution to global sea-level rise remains challenging, because in situ measurements over both space and time are sparse. Satellite remote-sensing data of ice elevations and ice motion show significant ice loss in the range of −31 to −196 Gt yr−1 in West Antarctica in recent years1, 2, 3, 4, whereas East Antarctica seems to remain in balance or slightly gain mass1, 2, 4, with estimated rates of mass change in the range of −4 to 22 Gt yr−1. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment5 (GRACE) offers the opportunity of quantifying polar ice-sheet mass balance from a different perspective6, 7. Here we use an extended record of GRACE data spanning the period April 2002 to January 2009 to quantify the rates of Antarctic ice loss. In agreement with an independent earlier assessment4, we estimate a total loss of 190±77 Gt yr−1, with 132±26 Gt yr−1 coming from West Antarctica. However, in contrast with previous GRACE estimates, our data suggest that East Antarctica is losing mass, mostly in coastal regions, at a rate of −57±52 Gt yr−1, apparently caused by increased ice loss since the year 2006.},

abstract = {We study on reduced dynamic orbit determination using differenced phase in adjacent epochs for spaceborne dual-frequency GPS. This method not only overcomes the shortcomings that the epoch-difference kinematic method cannot be used when observation geometry is poor or observations are insufficient, but also avoids solving the ambiguity in the zero-difference reduced dynamic method. As the epoch-difference method is not sensitive to the impact of phase cycle slips, it can lower the difficulty of slip detection in phase observation preprocessing. In the solution strategies, we solve the high-dimensional matrix computation problems by decomposing the long observation arc into a number of short arcs. By gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellite orbit determination and compared with GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) post science orbit, for epoch-difference reduced dynamic method, the root mean squares (RMSs) of radial, transverse and normal components are 1.92 cm, 3.83 cm and 3.80 cm, and the RMS in three dimensions is 5.76 cm. The solution's accuracy is comparable to the zero-difference reduced dynamic method. ?? 2011 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.},

Although this approach has been largely successful, information at submonthly time scales can be lost or even aliased through the estimation of static monthly parameters. Through an analysis of the GRACE data residuals, we show that the fundamental temporal and spatial resolution of the GRACE data is 10 days and 400 km. We present an approach similar in concept to altimetric methods that recovers submonthly mass flux at a high spatial resolution. Using 4� � 4� blocks at 10-day intervals, we estimate the mass of surplus or deficit water over a 52� � 60� grid centered on the Amazon basin for July 2003. We demonstrate that the recovered signals are coherent and correlate well with the expected hydrological signal.},

abstract = {We explored the hypothesis that Mab's anomalous orbital motion, as deduced from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data (Showalter and Lissauer, 2006), is the result of gravitational interactions with a putative suite of large bodies in the $\mu$-ring. We conducted simulations to compute the gravitational effect of Mab (a recently discovered Uranian moon) on a cloud of test particles. Subsequently, by employing the data extracted from the test particle simulations, we executed random walk simulations to compute the back-reaction of nearby perturbers on Mab. By generating simulated observation metrics, we compared our results to the data retrieved from the HST. Our results indicate that the longitude residual change noted in the HST data ($\Delta$$\lambda$r,Mab≈1 deg) is well matched by our simulations. The eccentricity variations ($\Delta$eMab≈10-3) are however typically two orders of magnitude too small. We present a variety of reasons that could account for this discrepancy. The nominal scenario that we investigated assumes a perturber ring mass (mring) of 1 mMab (Mab's mass) and a perturber ring number density ($\rho$n,ring) of 10 perturbers per 3 RHill,Mab (Mab's Hill radius). This effectively translates to a few tens of perturbers with radii of approximately 2 to 3 km, depending on the albedo assumed. The results obtained also include an interesting litmus test: variations of Mab's inclination on the order of the eccentricity changes should be observable. Our work provides clues for further investigation into the tantalizing prospect that the Mab/$\mu$-ring system is undergoing re-accretion after a recent catastrophic disruption.},

We developed advanced laser retroreflectors for solar system exploration, geodesy and for precision tests of General Relativity (GR) and new gravitational physics. Our key experimental innovation is the concurrent measurement and modeling of the optical Far Field Diffraction Pattern (FFDP) and the temperature distribution of the SLR/LLR payload of retroreflectors under thermal conditions produced with a close-match solar simulator. The primary goal of these innovative tools is to provide critical design and diagnostic capabilities for SLR to Galileo and other GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) constellations. The implementation of new retroreflectors designs being studied will be helpful to improve GNSS orbits, increasing, this way, accuracy, stability, and distribution of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), in order to provide a better definition of the geocenter (origin) and the scale (length unit). The SCF is also actively used to develop, validate and optimize 2nd generation LLR arrays for precision tests of GR with the MoonLIGHT-2 (Moon Laser Instrumentation for General relativity High-accuracy Tests - Phase 2) project. Laser ranging and laser reflectors throughout the solar system are also used to develop new fundamental gravity physics models and study the experimental constraints to these models.},

abstract = {The Arctic plays a fundamental role in the climate system and shows signifi- cant sensitivity to anthropogenic climate forcing and the ongoing climate change. Accel- erated changes in the Arctic are already observed, including elevated air and ocean temperatures, declines of the summer sea ice extent and sea ice thickness influencing the albedo and CO2 exchange, melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and increased thawing of surrounding permafrost regions. In turn, the hydrological cycle in the high latitude and Arctic is expected to undergo changes although to date it is challenging to accurately quantify this. Moreover, changes in the temperature and salinity of surface waters in the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas may also influence the flow of dense water through the Denmark Strait, which are found to be a precursor for changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation with a lead time of around 10 years (Hawkins and Sutton in Geophys Res Lett 35:L11603, 2008). Evidently changes in the Arctic and surrounding seas have far reaching influences on regional and global environment and climate variability, thus emphasizing the need for advanced quantitative understanding of the ocean circulation and transport variability in the high latitude and Arctic Ocean. In this respect, this study combines in situ hydrographical data, surface drifter data and direct current meter mea- surements, with coupled sea ice–ocean models, radar altimeter data and the latest GOCE- based geoid in order to estimate and assess the quality, usefulness and validity of the new GOCE-derived mean dynamic topography for studies of the ocean circulation and transport estimates in the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean.},

abstract = {A numerical study has been conducted in order to estimate how a gravity field model obtained from GOCE data can be improved in the range of low degrees by addition of GRACE data. The GRACE data are simulated as inter-satellite accelerations. Different types of noise in the inter-satellite accelerations are considered, including white noise. The gravity field model is represented as a series of spherical harmonics; the Stokes coefficients are computed by a least-squares adjustment. It is shown that the incorporation of GRACE data may improve a GOCE-based gravity field model up to degree 120 or even higher depending on the type of noise in the inter-satellite accelerations. Moreover, the joint model at lower degrees may show a significantly higher quality that either a stand-alone GOCE-based or a stand-alone GRACE-based model. It is important, however, that proper covariance matrices of the involved data sets are used in the joint data processing.},

Its preliminary orbital analyses show that LARES behaves as the best artificial massive test particle today available in the solar system, providing an optimal approximation to the time-like geodesic motion of General Relativity.

In this study we investigate whether and how such an 'altimetric-hydrodynamic' geoid over the North Sea can serve for validating satellite-gravimetric geoids. Our results indicate that, using ERS-2 and ENVISAT along-track altimetry and water levels from the high-resolution operational circulation model BSHcmod, we do find distinct differences in RMS fits for various state-of-the art satellite-only models (beyond degree 145 for GRACE-only, and beyond degree 185 for GOCE-models) and for combined geoid models, very similar as seen in GPS-levelling validations over land areas. We find that, at spectral resolution of up to about 200, an RMS fit as low as about 7 cm can be obtained for the most recent GOCE-derived models such as GOCO05S.

abstract = {Groundwater is a primary source of fresh water in many parts of the world. Some regions are becoming overly dependent on it, consuming groundwater faster than it is naturally replenished and causing water tables to decline unremittingly. Indirect evidence suggests that this is the case in northwest India, but there has been no regional assessment of the rate of groundwater depletion. Here we use terrestrial water storage-change observations from the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and simulated soil-water variations from a data-integrating hydrological modelling system to show that groundwater is being depleted at a mean rate of 4.0 +/- 1.0 cm yr(-1) equivalent height of water (17.7 +/- 4.5 km(3) yr(-1)) over the Indian states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (including Delhi). During our study period of August 2002 to October 2008, groundwater depletion was equivalent to a net loss of 109 km(3) of water, which is double the capacity of India's largest surface-water reservoir. Annual rainfall was close to normal throughout the period and we demonstrate that the other terrestrial water storage components (soil moisture, surface waters, snow, glaciers and biomass) did not contribute significantly to the observed decline in total water levels. Although our observational record is brief, the available evidence suggests that unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic uses is likely to be the cause. If measures are not taken soon to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114,000,000 residents of the region may include a reduction of agricultural output and shortages of potable water, leading to extensive socioeconomic stresses.},

abstract = {Measurements of the CHAMP accelerometer are utilized to investigate the average thermospheric wind distribution in the polar regions at altitudes around 400 km. This study puts special emphasis on the seasonal differences in the wind patterns. For this purpose 131 days centered on the June solstice of 2003 are considered. Within that period CHAMP's orbit is precessing once through all local times. The cross-track wind estimates of all 2030 passes are used to construct mean wind vectors for 918 equal-area cells. These bin averages are presented in corrected geomagnetic coordinates. Both hemispheres are considered simultaneously providing summer and winter responses for the same prevailing geophysical conditions. The period under study is characterized by high magnetic activity (Kp=4&minus;) but moderate solar flux level (F10.7=124). Our analysis reveals clear wind features in the summer (Northern) Hemisphere. Over the polar cap there is a fast day-to-night flow with mean speeds surpassing 600 m/s in the dawn sector. At auroral latitudes we find strong westward zonal winds on the dawn side. On the dusk side, however, an anti-cyclonic vortex is forming. The dawn/dusk asymmetry is attributed to the combined action of Coriolis and centrifugal forces. Along the auroral oval the sunward streaming plasma causes a stagnation of the day-to-night wind. This effect is particularly clear on the dusk side. On the dawn side it is evident only from midnight to 06:00 MLT. The winter (Southern) Hemisphere reveals similar wind features, but they are less well ordered. The mean day-to-night wind over the polar cap is weaker by about 35%. Otherwise, the seasonal differences are mainly confined to the dayside (06:00-18:00 MLT). In addition, the larger offset between geographic and geomagnetic pole in the south also causes hemispheric differences of the thermospheric wind distribution.},

The goal of the study is twofold: (1) we demonstrate the feasibility of using residuals analysis for hydrological model validation in general and (2) we focus on the potential of the approach to investigate the signal content of temporally high-frequent (daily) modeled hydrological mass variations. In addition to the output of three different hydrological process models, we study mass changes computed from two different daily GRACE products. GRACE here serves as a reference, but its spatial resolution is limited and the daily models are not computed independently. Regarding aspect (1), our results show that the agreement of each of the models with GRACE varies strongly depending on geographical location. Aspect (2) is not only interesting for model validation, but it is also important in the context of improving the GRACE de-aliasing concept. We demonstrate that not only the daily GRACE models, but also the daily hydrological model output contains information on time scales smaller than 1 month. Realistically modeled or observed short-term hydrological mass changes may serve as additional de-aliasing product for GRACE and thus contribute to increasing the accuracy and resolution of future GRACE products.},

abstract = {Although frequency-entangled-based (FEB) sensor has advantages of precise ranging accuracy and potential enhanced safety, its performance of the distance measurement becomes poor during GRACE and some other GRACE-like missions (GRAIL) that are located at low Earth orbit (LEO) or have a large inter-satellite distance. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to analyze the essential cause of the above limitations and to propose two types of techniques to solve them, i.e.; shortening the accumulated time Ta and introducing the time-varying delay. Using a specific configuration of the entangled photons source, Ta is shortened to 0.126 s and the ranging accuracy can be lowered to 57.58 cm. However, affected by relative motion, this improved accuracy is still worse than what we expect. Adopting the shortened value of Ta of 0.126 s, we can essentially cancel the effect of relative motion by introducing the time-varying delay, and obtain a narrow accumulated profile determining a ranging accuracy in an order of mm which is only restricted by the resolution of coincidence system.},

abstract = {With the development of receiver equipment and GNSS and SBAS constellations, the coherent dual-frequency L-band transmissions are now available from a number of geostationary satellites. These signals can be used for ionospheric total electron content (TEC) estimation. The quality of these data, i.e., the level of noise in such TEC estimation is of great interest and importance. We present results of comparisons of noise patterns in TEC estimation using signals of geostationary satellites of augmentation systems such as the Indian GAGAN, the European EGNOS and the American WAAS, as well as the signals from the Chinese Beidou navigation system. We used data from two receiving sites in the European part of Russia and the USA, which are equipped with JAVAD Delta receivers. We found out that the noise level in TEC estimation based on geostationary satellites of the Beidou system is one order smaller than that for SBAS and corresponds to those of GPS/GLONASS at the same elevation angles. Typically, the TEC RMS was about 0.05 TECU for GPS/GLONASS satellites at elevation range 5–15°, 0.06 TECU for Beidou geostationary satellites at elevation range 15–25°, 0.6 TECU for GAGAN at elevation range 15–25°, 0.7 TECU for WAAS at elevation 45°, and 5 TECU for EGNOS at elevation 20°. We also discuss the capabilities of geostationary TEC observations in connection with the recent G4 geomagnetic storm of March 2015 using six IGS MGEX stations in the American, Southeast Asian and Australian sectors. We demonstrate the hemispheric asymmetry in the ionospheric TEC response during this storm. {\textcopyright} 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

abstract = {AbstractData from the Jason-2 calibration/validation mission phase have been analyzed to identify the correlation between sea surface height (SSH) and significant wave height (SWH) errors. A cross-spectral analysis indicates that the SSH and SWH errors are nearly white and significantly correlated at scales from 12 to 100 km, consistent with the hypothesized error source, the waveform retracker. Because of the scale separation between the SWH signal and noise, it is possible to correct the SSH data by removing the SSH noise correlated with the SWH noise. Such a correction has been implemented using the empirical correlation found during the Jason-2 calibration orbit phase and applied to independent data from other phases of the Jason-1 mission. The efficacy of the correction varies geographically, but variance reductions between 1.6 and 2.2 cm2 have been obtained, corresponding to reductions of 20%–27% in the noise floor of along-track spectra. The corrections are obtained from and applied to conventional...},

abstract = {We infer regional mass changes in Antarctica using ca. 4??years of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) level 2 data. We decompose the time series of the Stokes coefficients into their linear as well as annual and semi-annual components by a least-squares adjustment and apply a statistical reliability test to the Stokes potential-coefficients' linear temporal trends. Mass changes in three regions of Antarctica that display prominent geoid-height change are determined by adjusting predictions of glacier melting at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and in the Amundsen Sea Sector, and of the glacial-isostatic adjustment (GIA) over the Ronne Ice Shelf. We use the GFZ RL04, CNES RL01C, JPL RL04 and CSR RL04 potential-coefficient releases, and show that, although all data sets consistently reflect the prominent mass changes, differences in the mass-change estimates are considerably larger than the uncertainties estimated by the propagation of the GRACE errors. We then use the bootstrapping method based on the four releases and six time intervals, each with 3.5??years of data, to quantify the variability of the mean mass-change estimates. We find 95% of our estimates to lie within 0.08 and 0.09??mm/a equivalent sea-level (ESL) change for the Antarctic Peninsula and within 0.18 and 0.20??mm/a ESL for the Amundsen Sea Sector. Forward modelling of the GIA over the Ronne Ice Shelf region suggests that the Antarctic continent was covered by 8.4 to 9.4??m ESL of additional ice during the Last-Glacial Maximum (ca. 22 to 15??ka BP). With regards to the mantle-viscosity values and the glacial history used, this value is considered as a minimum estimate. The mass-change estimates derived from all GRACE releases and time intervals lie within ca. 20% (Amundsen Sea Sector), 30% (Antarctic Peninsula) and 50% (Ronne Ice Shelf region) of the bootstrap-estimated mean, demonstrating the reliability of results obtained using GRACE observations. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to assess the mass changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), Ice Sheets over Antarctica, and Land glaciers and Ice Caps with a global mascon method that yields monthly mass variations at 10,242 mascons. Input for this method are level 2 data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system collected between February 2003 and June 2013 to which a number of corrections are made. With glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) corrections from an ensemble of models based on different ice histories and rheologic Earth model parameters, we find for Greenland a mass loss of −278 ± 19 Gt/yr. Whereas the mass balances for the GrIS appear to be less sensitive to GIA modeling uncertainties, this is not the case with the mass balance of Antarctica. Ice history models for Antarctica were recently improved, and updated historic ice height data sets and GPS time series have been used to generate new GIA models. We investigated the effect of two new GIA models for Antarctica and found −92 ± 26 Gt/yr which is half of what is obtained with ICE-5G-based GIA models, where the largest GIA model differences occur on East Antarctica. The mass balance of land glaciers and ice caps currently stands at −162 ± 10 Gt/yr. With the help of new GIA models for Antarctica, we assess the mass contribution to the mean sea level at 1.47 ± 0.09 mm/yr or 532 ± 34Gt/yr which is roughly half of the global sea level rise signal obtained from tide gauges and satellite altimetry.},

abstract = {River discharge is a critical component for understanding hydrological processes and sustainable management of water resources. The importance of discharge observation has increased due to its potential extreme variation resulting from the projected climate change and stronger variability of precipitation and temperature in some large basins. However, inherent difficulties in ground-based observations and decreasing number of gauge stations hinder accurate measurement of global river discharge and its spatio-temporal variations. Various remote sensing methods have been examined as alternatives, however, they require ground measurements to convert their proxy measurements into the actual river discharge. In this study, we estimate the discharge at the {\'{O}}bidos station and the mouth of the Amazon basin using the water storage variations derived from GRACE gravity data without relying on any auxiliary ground observations. We extract the water mass signal along the main stem of the river by applying the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) for water storage variations over the basin. The relative water storage variations along the main stem derived from the EOF decomposition are highly correlated with in-situ discharge at the {\'{O}}bidos. However, in high water season, the GRACE-based discharge is estimated larger than the in-situ observations, and the difference is particularly significant during the 2009 extreme flood season. We argue that the in-situ river discharge in 2009 was underestimated due to the missed water volume for the flow detouring around the {\'{O}}bidos gauge station during the high-flow event. Net river discharge of the Amazon Basin to Atlantic Ocean is also estimated, and its annual discharge is about 23% larger than that of the {\'{O}}bidos. In particular, 2009 river discharge to Atlantic Oceans is estimated as 1050 Gton.},

@article{Strode2016a,
abstract = {A new technique for detecting GNSS multipath interference by comparing signal-to-noise (SNR) measurements on three frequencies is presented. Depending on the phase lag of the reflected signal with respect to the direct signal, multipath interference can be either constructive or destructive, with a commensurate effect on the measured SNR. However, as the phase lag is frequency dependent, the SNR is perturbed differently on each frequency. Thus, by differencing SNR measurements on different frequencies and comparing the result with that obtained in a low-multipath environment, multipath can be detected. Using three frequencies makes the process more robust. A three-frequency SNR-based multipath detector has been developed and calibrated using measurements from GPS Block IIF satellites in a low-multipath environment. The new detector has been tested in a range of urban environments and its multipath detection capability verified by showing that the MP observables oscillate when the new detection statistic is above a threshold value determined using data collected in a low-multipath environment. The new detector is also sensitive to diffraction.},

@article{Schumacher2016b,
abstract = {Recently, ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF) have found increasing application for merging hydrological models with total water storage anomaly (TWSA) fields from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Previous studies have disregarded the effect of spatially correlated errors of GRACE TWSA products in their investigations. Here, for the first time, we systematically assess the impact of the GRACE error correlation structure on EnKF data assimilation into a hydrological model, i.e. on estimated compartmental and total water storages and model parameter values. Our investigations include (1) assimilating gridded GRACE-derived TWSA into the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model and, simultaneously, calibrating its parameters; (2) introducing GRACE observations on different spatial scales; (3) modelling observation errors as either spatially white or correlated in the assimilation procedure, and (4) replacing the standard EnKF algorithm by the square root analysis scheme or, alternatively, the singular evolutive interpolated Kalman filter. Results of a synthetic experiment designed for the Mississippi River Basin indicate that the hydrological parameters are sensitive to TWSA assimilation if spatial resolution of the observation data is sufficiently high. We find a significant influence of spatial error correlation on the adjusted water states and model parameters for all implemented filter variants, in particular for subbasins with a large discrepancy between observed and initially simulated TWSA and for north--south elongated sub-basins. Considering these correlated errors, however, does not generally improve results: while some metrics indicate that it is helpful to consider the full GRACE error covariance matrix, it appears to have an adverse effect on others. We conclude that considering the characteristics of GRACE error correlation is at least as important as the selection of the spatial discretisation of TWSA observations, while the choice of the filter method might rather be based on the computational simplicity and efficiency.},

@article{Flechtner2016,
abstract = {The primary objective of the gravity recovery and climate experiment follow-on (GRACE-FO) satellite mission, due for launch in August 2017, is to continue the GRACE time series of global monthly gravity field models. For this, evolved versions of the GRACE microwave instrument, GPS receiver, and accelerometer will be used. A secondary objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a laser ranging interferometer (LRI) in improving the satellite-to-satellite tracking measurement performance. In order to investigate the expected enhancement for Earth science applications, we have performed a full-scale simulation over the nominal mission lifetime of 5 years using a realistic orbit scenario and error assumptions both for instrument and background model errors. Unfiltered differences between the synthetic input and the finally recovered time-variable monthly gravity models show notable improvements with the LRI, on a global scale, of the order of 23 %. The gain is realized for wavelengths smaller than 240 km in case of Gaussian filtering but decreases to just a few percent when anisotropic filtering is applied. This is also confirmed for some typical regional Earth science applications which show randomly distributed patterns of small improvements but also degradations when using DDK4-filtered LRI-based models. Analysis of applied error models indicates that accelerometer noise followed by ocean tide and non-tidal mass variation errors are the main contributors to the overall GRACE-FO gravity model error. Improvements in these fields are therefore necessary, besides optimized constellations, to make use of the increased LRI accuracy and to significantly improve gravity field models from next-generation gravity missions.},

abstract = {AbstractIt is a common practice to analyze fracture spacing data collected from scanlines and wells at various resolutions for the purposes of aquifer and reservoir characterization. However, the influence of resolution on such analyses is not well-studied. Lacunarity is a parameter that is used for multiscale analysis of spatial data. In quantitative terms, at any given scale, it is a function of the mean and variance of the distribution of masses captured by a gliding a window of that scale (size) across any pattern of interest. We have described the application of lacunarity for delineating differences between scale-dependent clustering attributes of data collected at different resolutions along a scanline. Specifically, we considered data collected at different resolutions from two outcrop exposures, a pavement and a cliff section, of the Cretaceous turbititic sandstones of the Chatsworth Formation widely exposed in southern California. For each scanline, we analyzed data from low-resolution aerial or...},

abstract = {We present a spatial averaging method for Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity-field solutions based on the Wiener optimal filtering. The optimal filter is designed from the least-square minimization of the difference between the desired and filtered signals. It requires information about the power spectra of the desired gravitational signal and the contaminating noise, which is inferred from the average GRACE degree-power spectrum. We show that the signal decreases with increasing spherical harmonic degree j with approximately j−b, where b = 1.5 for GRACE data investigations. This is termed the Second Kaula rule of thumb for temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field. The degree power of the noise increases, in the logarithmic scale, linearly with increasing j. The Wiener optimal filter obtained for the signal model with b = 1.5 closely corresponds to a Gaussian filter with a spatial half width of 4° (∼440 km). We find that the filtered GRACE gravity signal is relatively insensitive to the exponent b of the signal model, which indicates the robustness of Wiener optimal filtering. This is demonstrated using the GFZ-GRACE gravity-field solution for April 2004.},

If we are satisfied with obtaining a smooth solution for the Earth's gravity field, we can use the formulas in regional gravity field modelling. In such a case, satellite gradiometric data are integrated on a sphere at satellite level and continued downward to the disturbing potential (geoid) at sea level simultaneously. This paper investigates the gravity field modelling from a full tensor of gravity at satellite level. It studies the truncation bias of the integrals as well as the filtering of noise of data. Numerical studies show that by integrating Tzz with 1 mE noise and in a cap size of 7°, the geoid can be recovered with an error of 12 cm after the filtering process. Similarly, the errors of the recovered geoids from Txz,yz and Txx-yy, 2xy are 13 and 21 cm, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2010 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of water storage changes in the world's major hydrological catchment basins on global and regional sea level change at seasonal and long-term time scales. In a joint inversion using GRACE and Jason-1 data, we estimate the time-dependent sea level contributions of 124 spatial patterns (“fingerprints”) including glacier and ice sheet melting, thermal expansion, changes in the terrestrial hydrological cycle, and glacial isostatic adjustment. Particularly, for hydrological storage changes, we derive fingerprints of the 33 world's largest catchment basins, assuming mass distributions derived from the leading EOFs of total water storage in the WaterGap Global Hydrological Model (WGHM). From our inversion, we estimate a contribution of terrestrial hydrological cycle changes to global mean sea level of − 0.20 ± 0.04 mm/yr with an annual amplitude of 6.6 ± 0.5 mm for August 2002 to July 2009. Using only GRACE data in the inversion and comparing to hydrological changes derived from GRACE data directly using a basin averaging method shows a good agreement on a global scale, but considerable differences are found for individual catchment basins (up to 180%). Hydrological storage change estimates in 33 basins from the GRACE/Jason fingerprint inversion indicate a trend 46% smaller and an annual amplitude 43% bigger compared to WGHM-derived storage changes. Mapping the hydrological trends to regional sea level reveals the strongest sea level rise along the coastlines of South America (max 0.9 mm/yr) and West Africa (max 0.4 mm/yr), whereas around Alaska and Australia, we find the hydrological component of sea level falling (min −2.0 mm/yr and −0.9 mm/yr).},

@book{Tapley1973,
abstract = {The modern field of orbit determination (OD) originated with Kepler's inter- pretations of the observations made by Tycho Brahe of the planetary motions. Based on the work of Kepler, Newton was able to establish the mathematical foundation of celestial mechanics. During the ensuing centuries, the efforts to im- prove the understanding of the motion of celestial bodies and artificial satellites in the modern era have been a major stimulus in areas of mathematics, astronomy, computational methodology and physics. Based on Newton's foundations, early efforts to determine the orbit were focused on a deterministic approach in which a few observations, distributed across the sky during a single arc, were used to find the position and velocity vector of a celestial body at some epoch. This uniquely categorized the orbit. Such problems are deterministic in the sense that they use the same number of independent observations as there are unknowns. With the advent of daily observing programs and the realization that the or- bits evolve continuously, the foundation of modern precision orbit determination evolved from the attempts to use a large number of observations to determine the orbit. Such problems are over-determined in that they utilize far more observa- tions than the number required by the deterministic approach. The development of the digital computer in the decade of the 1960s allowed numerical approaches to supplement the essentially analytical basis for describing the satellite motion and allowed a far more rigorous representation of the force models that affect the motion. This book is based on four decades of classroom instruction and graduate- level research. The material has been derived from and shared with numerous colleagues and students. In addition to the contributions of these individuals, the material has been influenced by the approaches used at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to fulfill Earth and planetary navigation requirements and at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the Department of Defense Naval Surface Weapons Center in applications of satellite tracking to problems in geodesy, geodynamics, and oceanography. Various implementations of the tech- niques described have been accomplished over the years to meet the requirements to determine the orbit of specific spacecraft. xi xiiPreface This book is focused on developing data processing techniques for estimating the state of a non-linear dynamic system. The book contains six chapters and eight appendices, each covering a unique aspect of the OD problem. Although the concepts will be discussed primarily in the context of Earth-orbiting satellites or planetary transfers, the methods are applicable to any non-linear system and have been applied to such widely diverse problems as describing the state of economic systems, chemical processes, spacecraft attitude, and aircraft and missile guidance and navigation. In Chapter 1, the inherent characteristics of the OD problem are introduced in the context of a very simple dynamic problem. The concepts of the dynamic system and its associated state are introduced. The fact that essentially all obser- vations are non-linear functions of the state variables and the complexities asso- ciated with this are discussed. The classical or well-determined problem and the over-determined problem are described as examples of the approaches used in the following chapters. Chapter 2 lays the background for the OD problem by introducing the relevant elements of orbital mechanics. The concept of perturbed two body motion and its role in the description of orbital motion is discussed. The fundamental forces acting on the satellite are described, especially within the context of an accurate description of the orbit. Finally, the definitions of the coordinate systems used to describe the motion and the time conventions used to index the observations and describe the satellite position are given. Chapter 3 describes the various types of observations that are used to mea- sure the satel ites motion. This includes ground-based systems such as laser and radiometric, as well as space-based measurements from the Global Positioning System. Error sources and media corrections needed for these observation types also are described. In the problem of orbit determination, the observations de- scribed in this chapter will be the input to the estimation methodologies in the following chapters. In Chapter 4, the orbit problem is formulated in state space notation and the non-linear orbit determination problem is reduced to an approximating linear state estimation problem by expanding the system dynamics about an a priori reference orbit. This concept allows application of an extensive array of mathematical tools from linear system theory that clarify the overall problem and aid in transferring the final algorithms to the computational environment. Chapter 4 also introduces the important concept of sequential processing of the observations, and the rela- tion to the Kalman Filter, and relates the algorithm to the observation and control of real time processes. Chapter 5 addresses issues related to the numerical accuracy and stability of the computational process, and formulates the square root computational algo- rithms. These algorithms are based on using a series of orthogonal transforma- tions to operate on the information arrays in such a way that the requirement for formation of the normal equations is eliminated. The approach is used to develop both batch and sequential data processing algorithms. Chapter 6 explores the very important problem of assessing the effect of error in unestimated measurement and force model parameters. The effects of incorrect statistical information on the a priori state and observation noise are examined and the overall process is known as consider covariance analysis. The eight appendices provide background and supplemental information. This includes topics such as probability and statistics, matrix algebra, and coordinate transformations. The material can be used in several ways to support graduate or senior level courses. Chapters 1, 3, and 4, along with Appendices A, B, F, and G provide the basis for a one-semester OD class. Chapters 5 and 6, along with Appendix A, provide the basis for a one-semester advanced OD class. Chapter 2 could serve as supplemental information for the first semester class as well as an introductory orbit mechanics class. Each chapter has a set of problems selected to emphasize the concepts described in the chapter.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s)In GNSS data processing, the station height, receiver clock and tropospheric delay (ZTD) are highly correlated to each other. Although the zenith hydrostatic delay of the troposphere can be provided with sufficient accuracy, zenith wet delay (ZWD) has to be estimated, which is usually done in a random walk process. Since ZWD temporal variation depends on the water vapor content in the atmosphere, it seems to be reasonable that ZWD constraints in GNSS processing should be geographically and/or time dependent. We propose to take benefit from numerical weather prediction models to define optimum random walk process noise. In the first approach, we used archived VMF1-G data to calculate a grid of yearly and monthly means of the difference of ZWD between two consecutive epochs divided by the root square of the time lapsed, which can be considered as a random walk process noise. Alternatively, we used the Global Forecast System model from National Centres for Environmental Prediction to calculate random walk process noise dynamically in real-time. We performed two representative experimental campaigns with 20 globally distributed International GNSS Service (IGS) stations and compared real-time ZTD estimates with the official ZTD product from the IGS. With both our approaches, we obtained an improvement of up to 10% in accuracy of the ZTD estimates compared to any uniformly fixed random walk process noise applied for all stations.},

abstract = {The European Space Agency Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circular Explorer (GOCE) carries a gradiometer consisting of three pairs of accelerometers in an orthogonal triad. Precise GOCE science orbit solutions (PSO), which are based on satellite-to-satellite tracking observations by the Global Positioning System and which are claimed to be at the few cm precision level, can be used to calibrate and validate the observations taken by the accelerometers. This has been done for each individual accelerometer by a dynamic orbit fit of the time series of position co-ordinates from the PSOs, where the accelerometer observations represent the non-gravitational accelerations. Since the accelerometers do not coincide with the center of mass of the GOCE satellite, the observations have to be corrected for rotational and gravity gradient terms. This is not required when using the so-called common-mode accelerometer observations, provided the center of the gradiometer coincides with the GOCE center of mass. Dynamic orbit fits based on these common-mode accelerations therefore served as reference. It is shown that for all individual accelerometers, similar dynamic orbit fits can be obtained provided the above-mentioned corrections are made. In addition, accelerometer bias estimates are obtained that are consistent with offsets in the gravity gradients that are derived from the GOCE gradiometer observations.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the quantification of ongoing mass and\nvolume changes over the Greenland ice sheet. For that purpose, we\nused elevation changes derived from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation\nSatellite (ICESat) laser altimetry mission and monthly variations\nof the Earth's gravity field as observed by the Gravity Recovery\nand Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission.\n\n\nBased on a stand alone processing scheme of ICESat data, the most\nprobable estimate of the mass change rate from 2003 February to 2007\nApril equals ?139 ± 68 Gton yr?1. Here, we used a density of 600\n± 300 kg m?3 to convert the estimated elevation change rate in the\nregion above 2000 m into a mass change rate. For the region below\n2000 m, we used a density of 900 ± 300 kg m?3.\n\n\nBased on GRACE gravity models from half 2002 to half 2007 as processed\nby CNES, CSR, DEOS and GFZ, the estimated mass change rate for the\nwhole of Greenland ranges between ?128 and ?218 Gton yr?1.\n\n\nMost GRACE solutions show much stronger mass losses as obtained with\nICESat, which might be related to a local undersampling of the mass\nloss by ICESat and uncertainties in the used snow/ice densities.\n\n\nTo solve the problem of uncertainties in the snow and ice densities,\ntwo independent joint inversion concepts are proposed to profit from\nboth GRACE and ICESat observations simultaneously. The first concept,\ndeveloped to reduce the uncertainty of the mass change rate, estimates\nthis rate in combination with an effective snow/ice density. However,\nit turns out that the uncertainties are not reduced, which is probably\ncaused by the unrealistic assumption that the effective density is\nconstant in space and time. The second concept is designed to convert\nGRACE and ICESat data into two totally new products: variations of\nice volume and variations of snow volume separately. Such an approach\nis expected to lead to new insights in ongoing mass change processes\nover the Greenland ice sheet. Our results show for different GRACE\nsolutions a snow volume change of ?11 to 155 km3 yr?1 and an ice\nloss with a rate of ?136 to ?292 km3 yr?1.},

@article{Wang2013f,
abstract = {The motion of a point mass in the J 2 problem is generalized to that of a rigid body in a J 2 gravity field. The linear and nonlinear stability of the classical type of relative equilibria of the rigid body, which have been obtained in our previous paper, are studied in the framework of geometric mechanics with the second-order gravitational potential. Non-canonical Hamiltonian structure of the problem, i.e., Poisson tensor, Casimir functions and equations of motion, are obtained through a Poisson reduction process by means of the symmetry of the problem. The linear system matrix at the relative equilibria is given through the multiplication of the Poisson tensor and Hessian matrix of the variational Lagrangian. Based on the characteristic equation of the linear system matrix, the conditions of linear stability of the relative equilibria are obtained. The conditions of nonlinear stability of the relative equilibria are derived with the energy-Casimir method through the projected Hessian matrix of the variational Lagrangian. With the stability conditions obtained, both the linear and nonlinear stability of the relative equilibria are investigated in details in a wide range of the parameters of the gravity field and the rigid body. We find that both the zonal harmonic J 2 and the characteristic dimension of the rigid body have significant effects on the linear and nonlinear stability. Similar to the classical attitude stability in a central gravity field, the linear stability region is also consisted of two regions that are analogues of the Lagrange region and the DeBra-Delp region respectively. The nonlinear stability region is the subset of the linear stability region in the first quadrant that is the analogue of the Lagrange region. Our results are very useful for the studies on the motion of natural satellites in our solar system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

As a test of the GGM01 gravity model, large-scale zonal and meridional surface geostrophic currents are computed from the topography and are compared with those derived from a mean hydrographic surface. Reduction in residual RMS between the two by 30–60% (and increased correlation) indicates that the GGM01 geoid represents a dramatic improvement over older geoid models, which were developed from multiple satellite tracking data, altimetry, and surface gravity measurements. For the first time, all major current systems are clearly observed in the DOT from space-based measurements.},

@article{Scargle1982,
abstract = {Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples.},

abstract = {Based on the latest release of the SGP4/SDP4 (Simplified General Perturbation Version 4/ Simplified Deep-space Perturbation Version 4) model, in this paper we have designed an orbit determination program. Through calculations for the 1120 objects with various types and orbital elements selected from the space objects database, we have obtained the accuracies of the orbit determination prediction dealt with various types of space objects by the SGP4/SDP4 model. The results show that the accuracies of the near-earth objects are in the order of magnitude of 100 meters; the averages of the orbit determination accuracies of the semi-synchronous and geosynchronous orbits are, respectively, 0.7 and 1.9 km. The orbit determination accuracies of the elliptical orbit objects are related to their eccentricities. Except for few elliptical orbit objects with e > 0.8, the orbit determination errors of the vast majority of the elliptical orbit objects are all less than 10 km. By using the SGP4/SDP4 model to make 3 days predictions for near-earth objects, 30 days for semi-synchronous orbit objects, 15 days for geosynchronous orbit objects and 1 day for elliptical orbit objects, the errors of prediction generally don't exceed 40 km. ?? 2010.},

In our contribution we perform a regional analysis of GRACE data over Europe based on spherical wavelet/B-spline and global spherical harmonic solutions. Resulting temporal gravity field variations are expressed in terms of equivalent water mass variations which are subsequently compared and in balance with the net effect of precipitation and evaporation from the atmospheric flux convergence reduced by runoff from river gauge data for seven Central European river basins.},

abstract = {DORIS was developed for precise orbit determination and precise positioning on Earth. Three new satellites fitted out with dual-channel second-generation receivers have been recently launched. Jason-1, ENVISAT and SPOT-5 acquired a real autonomy thanks to DIODE real time on-board orbit determination software. Today the DORIS system has built up a global network of 55 stations. In order to reach new accuracy goals for Jason-1 and ENVISAT, it was decided to improve the long-term stability of the antennas when necessary. Third-generation beacons deployed from the end of 2001 offer new features and greater reliability. The satellites relay acquired and stored data at regular intervals to SSALTO, the new. DORIS mission control center. DORIS data from the different satellites are currently available in the two Data Centers and used by the International DORIS Service Analysis groups. ?? 2003 COSPAR.

abstract = {The Space Debris population has grown rapidly over the last few decades with the consequent growth of impact risk between current objects in orbit. Active Debris Removal (ADR) has been recommended to be put into practice by several National Agencies in order to remove objects that pose the biggest risk for the space community. The most immediate target that is being considered for ADR by the European Space Agency is the Earth-observing satellite Envisat. In order to safely remove such a massive object from its orbit, a capturing process followed by a controlled reentry is necessary. However, current ADR methods that require physical contact with the target have limitations on the maximum angular momentum that can be absorbed and a de-tumbling phase prior to the capturing process may be required. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for the ADR mission design to be able to predict accurately how the target will be rotating at the time of capture. This article analyses two perturbations that affect an object in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the Earth's gravity gradient and the eddy currents induced by the Earth's magnetic field. The gravity gradient is analysed using the equation of conservation of total energy and a graphical method is presented to understand the expected behaviour of any object under the effect of this perturbation. The eddy currents are also analysed by studying the total energy of the system. The induced torque and the characteristic time of decay are presented as a function of the object's magnetic tensor. In addition, simulations were carried out for the Envisat spacecraft including the gravity gradient perturbation as well as the eddy currents effect using the International Geomagnetic Reference Field IGRF-11 to model the Earth's magnetic field. These simulations show that the combined effect of these two perturbations is a plausible explanation for the rotational speed decay observed between April 2013 and September 2013.},

abstract = {High-resolution global gravity field models play a fundamental role in geodesy and Earth sciences, ranging from practical purposes, like precise orbit determination, to scientific applications, like investigations of the density structure of the Earth's inte- rior. In this contribution we present the latest EIGEN-model, EIGEN-GL05C (EIGEN = European Improved Gravity model of the Earth by New techniques), complete to de- gree and order 360 (corresponding to half-wavelength of 55 km), which was achieved jointly by GFZ Potsdam and GRGS Toulouse. As its precursor EIGEN-GL04C (re- leased in March 2006) the model is derived from a combination of GRACE and LA- GEOS satellite tracking data with surface gravity data; however, it is based on sub- stantial changes and improvements compared to the previous model. EIGEN-GL05C incorporates a further extended GRACE and LAGEOS data set, covering almost the whole GRACE period from mid 2002 to end of 2007, but also newly available grav- ity anomaly data for Europe and Australia. New processing features are the complete reprocessing of the GRACE and LAGEOS data using the recent RL04 standards and background models in GFZ (mixed with the GRACE/LAGEOS processing in GRGS based on the 10-day model series) and a further extension of full normal equations from terrestrial data to maximum degree and order 260 (restricted to 179 for EIGEN- ￼ GL04C). Another new topic investigated with EIGEN-GL05C is the estimation of secular and seasonal gravity variations for long and medium wavelengths simultane- ously along with mean gravity coefficients; this may provide a simple a priori model of conventionally unmodeled gravity field variations, e.g., from hydrology or secular changes in the ice shields which become relevant in many geodetic and geoscientific applications.},

abstract = {Apart from the gradiometer as the core instrument, the first ESA Earth Explorer Core Mission GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) will carry a 12-channel GPS receiver dedicated for precise orbit determination (POD) of the satellite. The EGG-C (European GOCE Gravity-Consortium), led by the Technical University in Munich, is building the GOCE HPF (High-level Processing Facility) dedicated to the Level 1b to Level 2 data processing. One of the tasks of this facility is the computation of the Precise Science Orbit (PSO) for GOCE. The PSO includes a reduced-dynamic and a kinematic orbit solution. The baseline for the PSO is a zero-difference procedure using GPS satellite orbits, clocks, and Earth Rotation Parameters (ERPs) from CODE (Center for Orbit Determination in Europe), one of the IGS (International GNSS Service) Analysis Centers. The scheme for reduced-dynamic and kinematic orbit determination is based on experiences gained from CHAMP and GRACE POD and is realized in one processing flow. Particular emphasis is put on maximum consistency in the analysis of day boundary overlapping orbital arcs, as well as on the higher data sampling rate with respect to CHAMP and GRACE and on differences originating from different GPS antenna configurations. We focus on the description of the procedure used for the two different orbit determinations and on the validation of the procedure using real data from the two GRACE satellites as well as simulated GOCE data. {\textcopyright} 2007 COSPAR.},

@article{HashemiFarahani2013,
abstract = {The ability of satellite gravimetry data to validate global static models of the Earth's gravity field is studied. Two types of data are considered: K-band ranging (KBR) data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and Satellite Gravity Gradiometry (SGG) data from the GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) mission. The validation is based on analysis of misfits obtained as the differences between the data observed and those computed with a force model that includes, in particular, a static gravity field model to be assessed. To facilitate the model assessment on a region-by-region basis, we convert KBR data into so-called range combinations, which are approximately equivalent to the intersatellite accelerations. We only use the accurately measured components of SGG data, that is, xx, yy, zz and xz components with x, y and z being along-track, cross-track and radial axes. We perform the validation in spectral and spatial domain. The latter requires elimination of low-frequency noise in the misfit data with a subsequent averaging over pre-defined blocks. Only 'independent' data are used, that is, those that have not been used in the production of the models under consideration. The proposed methodology is applied to eight models: EGM2008 (truncated at degree 250), EIGEN-6C (truncated at degree 250), two GRACE-only models (ITG-Grace03 and ITGGrace2010s) and four (satellite-only) combined GRACE/GOCE models (GOCO01S, EIGEN-6S, GOCO02S and DGM-1S). The latter is a novel model developed at Delft University of Technology in collaboration with GNSS Research Centre of Wuhan University. The GRACE KBR and GOCE SGG data demonstrate a pronounced sensitivity to inaccuracies of EGM2008 in 5-22 mHz (27-120 cycles-per-revolution, cpr) and 10-28 mHz (54-150 cpr) frequency ranges, respectively. The latter data also show a high sensitivity to inaccuracies of ITGGrace2010s in 25-37 mHz (135-200 cpr) frequency range. From the validation in the spatial domain, it is confirmed that independent data of both types allow a difference in performance of the models to be observed, despite the fact that the duration of these data is much shorter than that of data used to produce those models. It is shown that EGM2008 performs weaker than the combined GRACE/GOCE models (up to the highest spectral sensitivity of the validation data). Considering the root mean square misfits related to the zz gravity gradient componen t, the differences in performance are: 76-83 per cent in the continental areas poorly covered by terrestrial gravimetry measurements (Himalayas, South America and Equatorial Africa); 4-16 per cent in the continental areas well covered by these measurements (Australia, North Eurasia and North America); and 11 per cent in theworld's oceans (65°S-65°N). The identified differences in the regions of the latter two categories are related to the added value of the GOCE mission. It is shown that ITG-Grace03 and ITG-Grace2010s are of a much lower accuracy than EGM2008 in the gravimetrically well-surveyed continental areas: by 62-70 and 19-35 per cent and in the world's oceans: by 54 and 18 per cent, respectively. Nevertheless, the former models show a higher accuracy in the gravimetrically poorly surveyed continental areas: by 62-69 and 69-75 per cent, respectively. This difference is explained mostly by a loss of information content of ITG-Grace03 when it was combined with terrestrial gravimetry data to produce EGM2008. The KBR and SGG test data identify this loss of information content in 4-23 mHz (22-124 cpr) and 9-26 mHz (50-140 cpr) frequency ranges, respectively. It is shown that EIGEN-6C also suffers from a similar problem but in a much less pronounced manner. In South America, for instance, this model is found to perform somewhat poorer than its satellite-only counterpart, that is, EIGEN-6S, by about 12 per cent. The combined GRACE/GOCE models show in the poorly surveyed continental areas a higher accuracy than ITG-Grace2010s: by 23-36 per cent, which is attributed to the added value of the GOCE mission data. GOCO02S outperforms GOCO01S by not more than 2-5 per cent. DGM-1S and GOCO02S show an almost similar performance against SGG test data. However, the former model shows a slightly better agreement with KBR test data. Both models agree with test data better than EIGEN-6S. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2013.},

Using the principle of energy conservation, the satellite S positions and velocities are transformed into gravitational potential. CHAMP onboard micro-accelerometry is used to correct, for surface forces. For spherical harmonic analysis the so-called direct approach has been implemented using the full normal equation matrix.

The phenomenon we are focusing on here is the magnetospheric substorm. This paper presents substorm related observations of the thermosphere derived from the CHAMP satellite. With its sensitive accelerometer the satellite can measure the air density and zonal winds. Based on a large number of substorm events the average high and low latitude thermospheric response to substorm onsets was deduced. During magnetic substorms the thermospheric density is enhanced first at high latitudes. Then the disturbance travels at an average speed of 650 m/s to lower latitudes, and 3-4 h later the bulge reaches the equator on the night side. Under the influence of the Coriolis force the travelling atmospheric disturbance (TAD) is deflected westward. In accordance with present-day atmospheric models the disturbance zonal wind velocities during substorms are close to zero near the equator before midnight and attain moderate westward velocities after midnight. In general, the wind system is only weakly perturbed (Delta v(y)< 20 m/s) by substorms.},

The first and primary function of the NSC-1 is to provide star-light-in-quaternion-out attitude estimates, which it does at a rate of 5Hz with an accuracy of 0.002 degrees (7 arc-seconds), 1-sigma. The second function of the NSC-1 is to provide full-field images, with resolution greater than 1 mega-pixel. The images can be provided to the host at 1Hz to support functions such as pose determination for RPOD. Akin to typical hand-held cameras, the NSC-1 supports multiple exposure methods to maximize image quality of the object being viewed. It also supports multiple dynamic regions of interest that can be controlled independently, to optimize the image of an object while simultaneously viewing stars for attitude. The third function of the NSC-1 is to support space situational awareness (SSA) applications. The NSC-1 automatically detects objects moving relative to the star field and reports the information to the host spacecraft. Operating in the SSA mode, spacecraft can utilize the NSC-1 for vision based relative navigation applications. INTRODUCTION Nano-satellites, and in particularly CubeSats, have grown significantly in popularity over the past decade due in large part to the availability of secondary launch opportunities and the development of a standard interface 1 . Early CubeSats were relatively rudimentary and lacked high rate communications, precision attitude control and deployable solar arrays. These systems were also largely without a science focus. In recent years, based on the success of the National Science Foundation CubeSat program the science yield on these CubeSats has increased dramatically 2 . The results from the Radio Auroral Explorer (RAX-2), the Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE) and the Dynamic Ionosphere CubeSat Experiment (DICE) have all made significant scientific contributions 3,4,5 and have clearly shown the utility of CubeSats to conduct cutting edge science missions. One of the key subsystems necessary to enable future science missions is a precision attitude determination and control system. Accurate bus pointing to sub arc-minute levels will enable new space physics, astronomy and earth observing missions with CubeSats. Such increased pointing will also enable the use of narrow beam directional antennas for satellite-to-satellite cross-links and high rate data downlinks. While gyros, magnetometers, sun sensors and earth horizon crossing indicators can be utilized for attitude determination the fidelity of the attitude solution utilizing these components is typically on the order of 0.5°. To achieve sub arc-minute level pointing determination a star camera is required.

abstract = {A methodology is developed to analyze a multivariate linear model, which occurs in many geodetic and geophysical applications. Proper analysis of multivariate GPS coordinate time-series is considered to be an application. General, special, and more practical stochastic models are adopted to assess the noise characteristics of multivariate time-series. The least-squares variance component estimation (LS-VCE) is applied to estimate full covariance matrices among different series. For the special model, it is shown that the multivariate time-series can be estimated separately, and that the (cross) correlation between series propagates directly into the correlation between the corresponding parameters in the functional model. The time-series of five permanent GPS stations are used to show how the correlation between series propagates into the site velocities. The results subsequently conclude that the general model is close to the more practical model, for which an iterative algorithm is presented. The results also indicate that the correlation between series of different coordinate components per station is not significant. However, the spatial correlation between different stations for individual components is significant (a correlation of 0.9 over short baselines) both for white and for colored noise components.},

abstract = {This contribution investigates two different ways for mitigating the aliasing errors in ocean tides. This is done, on the one hand, by sampling the satellite observations in another direction using the pendulum satellite mission configuration. On the other hand, a mitigation of the temporal aliasing errors in the ocean tides can be achieved by using a suitable repeat period of the sub-satellite tracks. The findings show, firstly, that it is very beneficial for minimizing the aliasing errors in ocean tides to use pendulum configuration; secondly, optimizing the orbital parameter to get shorter repeat orbit mode can be effective in minimizing the aliasing errors. This paper recommends the pendulum as a candidate for future gravity mission to be launched in longer repeating orbit mode with shorter “sub-cycle” repeat periods to improve the temporal resolution of the satellite mission},

abstract = {The Swarm mission consists of three satellites orbiting the Earth at low orbital altitudes. The onboard GPS receivers, star cameras, and laser reflector make the Swarm mission an interesting candidate to explore the contribution of Swarm GPS data to the recovery of both the static and time-variable gravity fields. We use 1.5 years of Swarm GPS and attitude data to generate kinematic positions of high quality to perform gravity field determination using the Celestial Mechanics Approach. The generated gravity fields reveal severe systematic errors along the geomagnetic equator. Their size is correlated with the ionospheric density and thus strongly varying over the analyzed time period. Similar to the findings of the GOCE mission, the systematic errors are related to the Swarm GPS carrier phase data and may be reduced by rejecting GPS data affected by large ionospheric changes. Such a measure yields a strong reduction of the systematic errors along the geomagnetic equator in the gravity field recovery. Long wavelength signatures of the gravity field may then be recovered with a similar quality as achieved with GRACE GPS data, which makes the Swarm mission well suited to bridge a potential gap between the current GRACE and the future GRACE Follow-On mission.},

A matrix equation is derived relating total geocenter variations to the GRACE coefficients of degrees two and higher and to the oceanic component of the degree one coefficients. We estimate the oceanic component from two state-of-the-art ocean models. Results are compared to independent estimates of geocenter derived from other satellite data, such as satellite laser ranging and GPS. Finally, we compute degree one coefficients that are consistent with the processing applied to the GRACE Level-2 gravity field coefficients. The estimated degree one coefficients can be used to improve estimates of mass variability from GRACE, which alone cannot provide them directly.},

The spherical harmonic solutions released to date resolve the signal from surface hydrology over land areas at spatial scales of 750 to 1000 km over one month intervals [Wahr et al., 2004; Tapley et al., 2004]. In our local approach, we solve explicitly for the mass of water in surface blocks using only the KBRR data collected as GRACE overflies the region of interest. The local representation of gravity minimizes leakage of errors from other areas due to aliasing or mismodelling. In this paper, we report on the analysis of GRACE data from January 2003 through August 2004 over three regions: the Amazon, the Indian subcontinent, and the continental United States. We solve for mass change at 10-day intervals using 4 deg x 4 deg blocks. We give an overview of our latest results, and we present the results of error analyses, and comparisons to both hydrology models and in-situ data.},

Numerical simulation shows that, after entering the atmosphere, the majority of the tether' segments are broken down by aerodynamic forces and smoothly descend to the Earth s surface. This process is\r\naccompaniedby the formation of large loops,someof which can get beyondtheatmosphere. Meanwhile,someparts of the tether reach the surface of the Earth with considerable speed, jeopardizing both spaceborne andground objects in the equatorial plane.},

abstract = {The interaction and coupling of the Earth system components that include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and other fluids in Earth's interior, influence the Earth's shape, gravity field and its rotation (the three pillars of geodesy). The effects of global climate change, such as sea level rise, glacier melting, and geoharzards, also affect these observables. However, observations and models of Earth's system change have large uncertainties due to the lack of direct high temporal-spatial measurements. Nowadays, space geodetic techniques, particularly GNSS, VLBI, SLR, DORIS, InSAR, satellite gravimetry and altimetry provide a unique opportunity to monitor and, therefore, understand the processes and feedback mechanisms of the Earth system with high resolution and precision. In this paper, the status of current space geodetic techniques, some recent observations, and interpretations of those observations in terms of the Earth system are presented. These results include the role of space geodetic techniques, atmospheric-ionospheric sounding, ocean monitoring, hydrologic sensing, cryosphere mapping, crustal deformation and loading displacements, gravity field, geocenter motion, Earth's oblateness variations, Earth rotation and atmospheric-solid earth coupling, etc. The remaining questions and challenges regarding observing and understanding the Earth system are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The study “Geodesy and Time Reference in Space” (GETRIS), funded by European Space Agency (ESA), evaluates the potential and opportunities coming along with a global space-borne infrastructure for data transfer, clock synchronization and ranging. Gravity field recovery could be one of the first beneficiary applications of such an infrastructure. This paper analyzes and evaluates the two-way high-low satellite-to-satellite-tracking as a novel method and as a long-term perspective for the determination of the Earth's gravitational field, using it as a synergy of one-way high-low combined with low-low satellite-to-satellite-tracking, in order to generate adequate de-aliasing products. First planned as a constellation of geostationary satellites, it turned out, that an integration of European Union Global Navigation Satellite System (Galileo) satellites (equipped with inter-Galileo links) into a Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) constellation would extend the capability of such a mission constellation remarkably. We report about simulations of different Galileo and Low Earth Orbiter (LEO) satellite constellations, computed using time variable geophysical background models, to determine temporal changes in the Earth's gravitational field. Our work aims at an error analysis of this new satellite/instrument scenario by investigating the impact of different error sources. Compared to a low-low satellite-to-satellite-tracking mission, results show reduced temporal aliasing errors due to a more isotropic error behavior caused by an improved observation geometry, predominantly in near-radial direction within the inter-satellite-links, as well as the potential of an improved gravity recovery with higher spatial and temporal resolution. The major error contributors of temporal gravity retrieval are aliasing errors due to undersampling of high frequency signals (mainly atmosphere, ocean and ocean tides). In this context, we investigate adequate methods to reduce these errors. We vary the number of Galileo and LEO satellites and show reduced errors in the temporal gravity field solutions for this enhanced inter-satellite-links. Based on the GETRIS infrastructure, the multiplicity of satellites enables co-estimating short-period long-wavelength gravity field signals, indicating it as powerful method for non-tidal aliasing reduction.},

abstract = {Each of the GPS-derived time series consists of the deterministic (functional) and stochastic part. We propose that the deterministic part includes all periodicities from 1st to 9th harmonics of residual Chandler, tropical and draconitic periods and compare it with commonly used calculations of the annual and semi-annual tropical curve. Then, we address the issues of whether all residual periodicities, as proposed here, need to be taken into consideration when performing noise analysis. We use the position time series from 180 International GNSS Service stations obtained at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory using the GIPSY-OASIS software in a Precise Point Positioning mode. The longest series has 22.1 years of GPS daily solutions. The spectral indices range from --0.12 to --0.92, while the median values of ``global'' spectral indices are equal to: --0.41 {\textpm} 0.15, --0.38 {\textpm} 0.12 and --0.33 {\textpm} 0.18 for North, East and Up components, respectively. All non-modelled geophysical processes or non-included artificial effects in time series lead to an underestimation of errors of velocities, but also to changes in the velocity values themselves. The proposed assumption of seasonals subtraction caused the Akaike information criterion values to show a decrease in the median value of 30 {%}, which in fact means that all the seasonals mentioned here must be taken into account when analyzing noises. Finally, we noticed that there are some of the GPS stations that improved their velocity uncertainty even of 56 {%}.},

abstract = {The current lunar gravity field models are mostly concluded from lunar exploration programs either by observations of satellite orbit perturbations or by intersatellite ranging and ranging rate measurements between two low-orbiting spacecrafts. Especially, the measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) have been used to produce the Moon's gravity field models with spatial resolutions up to spherical harmonic degree 420 and 660 for the primary mission and extended mission, respectively. This paper presents a method using satellite gravity gradiometry, which not only can determine a moon's gravity field model with a higher resolution, but also can obtain the medium and short wavelength components information with a higher accuracy. This advantage is still obvious in comparison with the results from GRAIL's extended mission even though the maximum degree of the model derived from the mission is close to that achieved by the satellite gradiometry discussed in this study. Based on the simulations and analysis, a mission with the hypothesis of an orbit height of about 20 km, a mission duration of about 14 days, and a gradiometer accuracy level of about 30 mE/Hz is proposed, and it permits determination of a lunar gravity field model with a high accuracy of 14 mGal and a geoid with an accuracy of 20.5 cm, both at a spatial resolution of 7 km, corresponding to spherical harmonic degree and order 789. The effects of gravity gradient measurement errors, orbit height, tracking accuracy, mission duration and sampling rate are analytically investigated by the direct relationship between the satellite gravimetry measurements and coefficients of the Moon's gravitational potential, which is verified by the least-squares method. {\textcopyright} 2013 COSPAR.

abstract = {Although typically large uncertainties are associated with reservoir structure, the reservoir geometry is usually fixed to a single interpretation in history-matching workflows, and focus is on the estimation of geological properties such as facies location, porosity, and permeability fields. Structural uncertainties can have significant effects on the bulk reservoir volume, well planning, and predictions of future production. In this paper, we consider an integrated reservoir-characterization workflow for structural-uncertainty assessment and continuous updating of the structural reservoir model by assimilation of production data. We address some of the challenges linked to structural-surface updating with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). An ensemble of reservoir models, expressing explicitly the uncertainty resulting from seismic interpretation and time-to-depth conversion, is created. The top and bottom reservoir-horizon uncertainties are considered as a parameter for assisted history matching and are updated by sequential assimilation of production data using the EnKF. To avoid modifications in the grid architecture and thus to ensure a fixed dimension of the state vector, an elastic-grid approach is proposed. The geometry of a base-case simulation grid is deformed to match the realizations of the top and bottom reservoir horizons. The method is applied to a synthetic example, and promising results are obtained. The result is an ensemble of history-matched structural models with reduced and quantified uncertainty. The updated ensemble of structures provides a more reliable characterization of the reservoir architecture and a better estimate of the field oil in place.},

abstract = {Continued advancements in remote sensing technology along with a trend towards highly autonomous spacecraft provide a strong motivation for accurate real-time navigation of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensors nowadays enable a continuous tracking and provide low-noise radiometric measurements onboard a user spacecraft. Following the deactivation of Selective Availability a representative real-time positioning accuracy of 10 m is presently achieved by spaceborne global positioning system (GPS) receivers on LEO satellites. This accuracy can notably be improved by use of dynamic orbit determination techniques. Besides a filtering of measurement noise and other short-term errors, these techniques enable the processing of ambiguous measurements such as carrier phase or code-carrier combinations. In this paper a reference algorithm for real-time onboard orbit determination is described and tested with GPS measurements from various ongoing space missions covering an altitude range of 400–800 km. A trade-off between modeling effort and achievable accuracy is performed, which takes into account the limitations of available onboard processors and the restricted upload capabilities. Furthermore, the benefits of different measurements types and the available real-time ephemeris products are assessed. Using GPS broadcast ephemerides a real-time position accuracy of about 0.5 m (3D rms) is feasible with dual-frequency carrier phase measurements. Slightly inferior results (0.6–1 m) are achieved with single-frequency code-carrier combinations or dual-frequency code. For further performance improvements the use of more accurate real-time GPS ephemeris products is mandatory. By way of example, it is shown that the TDRSS Augmentation Service for Satellites (TASS) offers the potential for 0.1–0.2 m real-time navigation accuracies onboard LEO satellites.},

abstract = {West-African countries have been exposed to changes in rainfall patterns over the last decades, including a significant negative trend. This causes adverse effects on water resources, for instance reduced freshwater availability, and changes in the frequency, duration and magnitude of droughts and floods. Extracting the main patterns of water storage change in West Africa from remote sensing and linking them to climate variability, is therefore an essential step to understand the hydrological aspects of the region. In this study, the higher order statistical method of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is employed to extract statistically independent water storage patterns from monthly Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), from the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) and from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) products over West Africa, for the period 2002-2012. Then, to reveal the influences of climatic teleconnections on the individual patterns, these results were correlated to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) indices. To study the predictability of water storage changes, advanced statistical methods were applied on the main independent Sea Surface Temperature (SST) patterns over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans for the period 2002-2012 and the ICA results. Our results show a water storage decrease over the coastal regions of West Africa (including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Togo and Nigeria), associated with rainfall decrease. The comparison between GRACE estimations and WGHM results indicates some inconsistencies that underline the importance of forcing data for hydrological modeling of West Africa.

abstract = {For the development of a telescope that is capable of precisely tracking satellites and high-speed operation such as satellite laser ranging, a special method of telescope operation is required. This study aims to propose a new telescope operation method and system configuration for the independent development of a mount and an operation system which includes the host computer. Considering that the tracking of a satellite is performed in real time, communication and synchronization between the two independent subsystems are important. Therefore, this study applied the concept of time synchronization, which is used in various fields of industry, to the communication between the command computer and the mount. In this case, communication delays do not need to be considered in general, and it is possible to cope with data loss. Above all, when the mount is replaced in the future, only the general communication interface needs to be modified, and thus, it is not limited by replacement in terms of the overall system management. The performance of the telescope operation method developed in this study was verified by applying the method to the first mobile SLR system in Korea. This study is significant in that it proposed a new operation method and system configuration, to which the concept of time synchronization was applied, for the observation system that requires an optical telescope. {\textcopyright} 2014 COSPAR.},

GRACE-inferred TWS exhibits opposite patterns between north and south of the continental US from 2003 to 2012, with the equivalent water thickness increasing from -4.0 to 9.4 cm in the north and decreasing from 4.1 to -6.7 cm in the south. The equivalent water thickness also decreases by -5.1 cm in the middle south in 2006. GHDI is established to represent the extent of GRACE-inferred TWS anomaly departing from its historical average and is calibrated to resemble traditional Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI) in the continental US. GHDI exhibits good correlations with PHDI in the continental US, indicating its feasibility for drought monitoring. Since GHDI is GRACE-based and has minimal dependence of hydrological parameters on the ground, it can be extended for global drought monitoring, particularly useful for the countries that lack sufficient hydrological monitoring infrastructures on the ground.},

abstract = {A new approach to gravity eld modeling from GRACE KBR data is presented in detail. The functional model explicitly connects gravity eld parameters with a linear combination of range-rate measurements at three successive epochs. Unlike the functional model based on inter-satellite accelerations, the new one does not require the radial component of intersatellite velocity vectors to be determined from GPS data. Performance of the approach is tested with real GRACE data. A 176-day set and a one-month set are seperately processed. The mean gravity eld model computed from the 176-day data set is as accurate as the GGM01S model. The computed monthly model is 2-3 times less accurate than a model obtained by GFZ. The probable reason for a limited accuraccy of the computed monthly model is noise in inter-satellite baselines, which are still determined from GPS data.},

Previous studies have demonstrated the low sensitivity of GOCE to ocean tides and to temporal gravity field variations at the seasonal scale. In this study we investigate the sensitivity of satellite gradiometry missions such as GOCE to secular signals due to ice-mass change observed in Greenland and Antarctica. We show that unaccounted ice-mass change signal is likely to increase GOCE-related noise but that the expected present-day polar ice-mass change is below the GOCE sensitivity for an 18-month mission. Furthermore, 2–3 orders of magnitude improvement in the gradiometry in future gradiometer missions is necessary to detect ice-mass change with sufficient accuracy at the spatial resolution of interest.},

@article{Chen2007a,
abstract = {In order to effectively recover surface mass or geoid height changes from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) time-variable gravity models, spatial smoothing is required to minimize errors from noise. Spatial smoothing, such as Gaussian smoothing, not only reduces the noise but also attenuates the real signals. Here we investigate possible amplitude attenuations and phase changes of seasonal water storage variations in four drainage basins (Amazon, Mississippi, Ganges and Zambezi) using an advanced global land data assimilation system. It appears that Gaussian smoothing significantly affects GRACE-estimated basin-scale seasonal water storage changes, e.g., in the case of 800 km smoothing, annual amplitudes are reduced by about 25 40%, while annual phases are shifted by up to 10. With these effects restored, GRACE-estimated water storage changes are consistently larger than model estimates, indicating that the land surface model appears to underestimate terrestrial water storage change. Our analysis based on simulation suggests that normalized attenuation effects (from Gaussian smoothing) on seasonal water storage change are relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the true signal. This study provides a numerical approach that can be used to restore seasonal water storage change in the basins from spatially smoothed GRACE data.},

abstract = {As a possible alternative to rockets, the present article describes a new type of engine for space travel, based on the gravity-assist concept for space propulsion. The new engine is to a great extent inspired by the conversion of rotational angular momentum to orbital angular momentum occurring in tidal locking between astronomical bodies. It is also greatly influenced by Minovitch's gravity-assist concept, which has revolutionized modern space technology, and without which the deep-space probes to the outer planets and beyond would not have been possible. Two of the three gravitating bodies in Minovitch's concept are in the gravity-assist engine discussed in this article replaced by an extremely massive 'springbell' (in principle a spinning dumbbell with a powerful spring) incorporated into the spacecraft itself, and creating a three-body interaction when orbiting around a gravitating body. This makes gravity-assist propulsion possible without having to find suitably aligned astronomical bodies. Detailed numerical simulations are presented, showing how an actual spacecraft can use a ca 10-m diameter springbell engine in order to leave the earth???? 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Asteroids that could collide with the Earth are listed on the publicly available Near-Earth object (NEO) hazard web sites maintained by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA). The impact probability distribution of 69 potentially threatening NEOs from these lists that produce 261 dynamically distinct impact instances, or Virtual Impactors (VIs), were calculated using the Asteroid Risk Mitigation and Optimization Research (ARMOR) tool in conjunction with OrbFit. ARMOR projected the impact probability of each VI onto the surface of the Earth as a spatial probability distribution. The projection considers orbit solution accuracy and the global impact probability. The method of ARMOR is introduced and the tool is validated against two asteroid-Earth collision cases with objects 2008 TC3 and 2014 AA. In the analysis, the natural distribution of impact corridors is contrasted against the impact probability distribution to evaluate the distributions' conformity with the uniform impact distribution assumption. The distribution of impact corridors is based on the NEO population and orbital mechanics. The analysis shows that the distribution of impact corridors matches the common assumption of uniform impact distribution and the result extends the evidence base for the uniform assumption from qualitative analysis of historic impact events into the future in a quantitative way. This finding is confirmed in a parallel analysis of impact points belonging to a synthetic population of 10,006 VIs. Taking into account the impact probabilities introduced significant variation into the results and the impact probability distribution, consequently, deviates markedly from uniformity. The concept of impact probabilities is a product of the asteroid observation and orbit determination technique and, thus, represents a man-made component that is largely disconnected from natural processes. It is important to consider impact probabilities because such information represents the best estimate of where an impact might occur.},

abstract = {The atmospheric limb sounding technique making use of radio signals transmitted by the Global Position System (GPS) has emerged as a promising approach for global meteorological observations. As demonstrated by the proof-of-concept GPS Meteorology (GPS/MET) experiment and more recently by the CHAMP and SAC-C missions, the GPS radio occultation sounding data are of high accuracy and high vertical resolution. In late 2005, the joint U.S.-Taiwan COSMIC mission will be launched and is expected to collect up to 3,000 radio occultation soundings per day. These data will be available in near real-time for global weather analysis and prediction. The COSMIC data will also be valuable for climate monitoring and ionospheric research. Radio occultation measures phase and amplitude of the microwave signals emitted from GPS. These signals are inverted to obtain profiles of signal bending, atmospheric refractivity, pressure temperature and water vapor. The main purpose of the upcoming COSMIC mission is to demonstrate the value of these radio occultation products for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and space weather studies. This presentation will provide an overview of the COSMIC program, and its applications to weather and climate. For further information on COSMIC, please refer to http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/.},

abstract = {Continental water storage is a key variable in the Earth system that has never been adequately monitored globally. Since variations in water storage on land affect the time dependent component of Earth's gravity field, the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, which will accurately map the gravity field at 2-4 week intervals, may soon provide global data on temporal changes in continental water storage. This study characterizes water storage changes in 20 drainage basins ranging in size from 130,000 to 5,782,000 km2 and uses estimates of uncertainty in the GRACE technique to determine in which basins water storage changes may be detectable by GRACE and how this detectability may vary in space and time. Results indicate that GRACE will likely detect changes in water storage in most of the basins on monthly or longer time steps and that instrument errors, atmospheric modeling errors, and the magnitude of the variations themselves will be the primary controls on the relative accuracy of the GRACE-derived estimates.},

@article{Sasgen2010,
abstract = {We estimate the mass balance of eight drainage basins in West Antarctica from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data (GFZ RL04, GSM Level 2) using a constrained inverse-gravimetric approach. We consider InSAR observations of ice surface velocity as an indication of mass change, assuming that large mass loss occurs in areas of fast glacier flow. From these mass distribution functions we construct forward models of the geoid height change and their spatial correlations for each drainage basin. Then the difference between the GRACE data and the forward model is minimized by adjusting the total amount of mass change within each drainage basin. To overcome the ambiguity inherent in this inverse problem, we constrain its solution by including a priori estimates based on the InSAR mass-budget method. However, unconstrained (GRACE only) mass-change estimates can be recovered for three to four combined drainage basins. Differences between GRACE and InSAR values exist mainly for the Pine Island Glacier and Getz Ice Shelf region, resulting in a lower unconstrained GRACE total of -91.0 ± 3.5 Gt/yr (for the years 2002-2008) compared to the InSAR estimate of -116.6 ± 19.0 Gt/yr (outflow measurement for the years 1992, 1996, and 2006). There is evidence that this difference arises from anomalously large accumulation within the GRACE time interval (August 2002 to August 2008) in the Amundsen Sea sector and possibly from an overestimation of ice thickness for parts of the Bellinghausen Sea sector underlying the InSAR mass-budget values.},

abstract = {We investigate the range-rate residuals that come out of the gravity field parameter estimation, called the post-fit residuals, from the inter-satellite ranging data of the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission. Particularly, we investigate the high-frequency spectrum of the post-fit residuals (f > 20 mHz). Such analysis is carried out to understand the yet unsolved discrepancy between the predicted baseline errors and the observed ones. Initially, we analyse the characteristics of the signal-to-noise ratios of the four frequencies of the GRACE microwave ranging system. The SNR of the ranging system contains signatures of sun and moon intrusions, temperature changes in the instrument and changes in the magnetic torquer rod currents. Subsequent analysis of the high-frequency range- rate residuals reveals that they are affected by all the effects, except magnetic torquer rod currents. In order to ascertain the impact of these systematic errors on the estimated parameters, we compare the post-fit residuals with the pre-fit residuals. This comparison shows that at least 30 % of the systematic effects end up in the parameters estimated during gravity field parameter estimation.},

abstract = {New studies on the influence of inter-satellite range on the accuracy of the Earth's gravitational field recovery were carried out based on the Inter-satellite Range Interpolation Method (IRIM). Firstly, the IRIM observation equation by introducing the precise inter-satellite range into the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) component of the relative orbital position vector was established for the first time using the original satellite observations including the orbital position of the spaceborne Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, the inter-satellite range of the K-Band Ranging (KBR) system and the non-conservative force of the accelerometer (ACC). Secondly, the nine-point IRIM formula is shown by a comparison of multipoint IRIM formulas to be preferable for effectively improving the accuracy of the Earth's gravitational field recovery. Thirdly, the WHIGG-GEGM01S (GRACE Earth Gravity Model developed by Wuhan Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics) global gravity field model, complete up to degree and order 120, is produced using the GRACE Level-1B data products, acquired during 2008-01-01 to 2008-12-31 and released by the American Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Cumulative geoid height and gravity anomaly errors are 1.098×10-1m and 1.741×10-6m/s2 at degree 120, respectively. Finally, the availability of the WHIGG-GEGM01S model is validated by the GPS/Levelling observations in the U.S., Europe and Australia. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Currently, two satellite gravimetric missions (CHAMP, GRACE) are dedicated to the improvement of our knowledge of the geoid, and one (GOCE) is planned in the near future. This will allow the absolute altimeter ocean height measurements to be exploited, instead of only sea level variations. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the GRACE mission on ocean data assimilation. The new approach is to directly assimilate the full altimetric signal relative to the first release of a GRACE geoid. The response of an eddy-permitting ocean model of the North Atlantic to the assimilation of this altimetric signal is analysed. The results are compared to that obtained using the usual approach, i.e., the assimilation of the dynamic topography derived from the addition of altimetric sea level anomalies and a mean dynamic topography estimate. Even if the GRACE mission resolution (333 km) is not yet compatible with oceanographic studies at mid latitude, we show that the geoid estimate can already be used with success in basin scale altimetric data assimilation problems.},

abstract = {We deal with modelling of the geoid undulations for the European Plate by use of topographic and Moho data. Two models assuming linear density stratification in the lithosphere (constant contrast model CCM, constant gradient model CGM) and isostatic balance of the lithosphere were used for calculating the undulation in the flat layer approximation. The results show that the constant contrast model is able to describe the entire oceanic lithosphere, as it indicates the amplitude of thermal density change is in good agreement with the cooling plate model estimation. The constant gradient model gives reliable estimations of the lithosphere properties only in smaller regions of relatively uniform conditions like the Interior of the East European Craton. For continental and oceanic regions the resulting values of the density gradient have some average meaning and they are in interpretable correspondence with characteristic mantle heat flow. In the entire area, both models show strong confusion giving not intermediate and unrealistic lithosphere characterization, which is a result of essential differences of thermal constitution, differences in average crustal density and mineral differences of the lower lithosphere, occurring between the two major tectonic provinces (oceanic and continental). The convention of equivalent linear reduction was discussed extensively and applied as an adequate method of lithosphere thickness estimation. This approach leads to thickness determination similar to other methods (seismic, petrological and thermal). The two concepts allow for the construction of LAB (transitional zone between the lithosphere and asthenosphere) depth maps from topographic and Moho data.},

abstract = {The availability of data is a major challenge for hydrological modelling in large parts of the world. Remote sensing data can be exploited to improve models of ungauged or poorly gauged catchments. In this study we combine three datasets for calibration of a rainfall-runoff model of the poorly gauged Okavango catchment in Southern Africa: (i) surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates derived from radar measurements onboard the Envisat satellite; (ii) radar altimetry measurements by Envisat providing river stages in the tributaries of the Okavango catchment, down to a minimum river width of about one hundred meters; and (iii) temporal changes of the Earth's gravity field recorded by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) caused by total water storage changes in the catchment. The SSM data are shown to be helpful in identifying periods with over-respectively underestimation of the precipitation input. The accuracy of the radar altimetry data is validated on gauged subbasins of the catchment and altimetry data of an ungauged subbasin is used for model calibration. The radar altimetry data are important to condition model parameters related to channel morphology such as Manning's roughness. GRACE data are used to validate the model and to condition model parameters related to various storage compartments in the hydrological model (e. g. soil, groundwater, bank storage etc.). As precipitation input the FEWS-Net RFE, TRMM 3B42 and ECMWF ERA-Interim datasets are considered and compared.},

abstract = {The thermospheric response at satellite altitudes along low Earth orbit is subject to the energy deposition locally, i.e., at high altitudes, and the vertical wave propagation from the energy injection at lower altitudes. In this study, a general circulation model has been run to investigate the source of nonhydrostatic effects and the sensitivity of the vertical wind and neutral density at satellite orbits to the energy deposited at low and high altitudes. Through comparing the simulations with and without the Joule heating enhancement above 150 km altitude, the impact of the heating at low and high altitudes on the high-altitude thermosphere has been separated. The numerical simulations show that most of the nonhydrostatic effects at high altitudes (300 km) arise from sources below 150 km and propagate vertically through the acoustic wave. The heating above 150 km is responsible for a large increase of the average vertical velocity (40 m/s) and neutral density (50%) at 300 km and higher altitudes.},

The observed periodic changes of phase differences consist of frequencies, which in principle can be explained by the influence of solid earth tides, but also by other effects with similar periodicities. Only CLEAN enabled us to enlarge the time window over missing data segments until the frequency resolution was accurate enough to rule out solid earth tides as cause for the observed periodic changes.

abstract = {Different forms of fluctuations of the terrestrial gravity field are observed by gravity exper- iments. For example, atmospheric pressure fluctuations generate a gravity-noise foreground in measurements with super-conducting gravimeters. Gravity changes caused by high-magnitude earthquakes have been detected with the satellite gravity experiment GRACE, and we expect high-frequency terrestrial gravity fluctuations produced by ambient seismic fields to limit the sensitivity of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Accordingly, terrestrial grav- ity fluctuations are considered noise and signal depending on the experiment. Here, we will focus on ground-based gravimetry. This field is rapidly progressing through the development of GW detectors. The technology is pushed to its current limits in the advanced generation of the LIGO and Virgo detectors, targeting gravity strain sensitivities better than 10−23 Hz−1/2 above a few tens of a Hz. Alternative designs for GW detectors evolving from traditional gravity gradiometers such as torsion bars, atom interferometers, and superconducting gra- diometers are currently being developed to extend the detection band to frequencies below 1 Hz. The goal of this article is to provide the analytical framework to describe terrestrial gravity perturbations in these experiments. Models of terrestrial gravity perturbations re- lated to seismic fields, atmospheric disturbances, and vibrating, rotating or moving objects, are derived and analyzed. The models are then used to evaluate passive and active gravity noise mitigation strategies in GW detectors, or alternatively, to describe their potential use in geophysics. The article reviews the current state of the field, and also presents new analyses especially with respect to the impact of seismic scattering on gravity perturbations, active gravity noise cancellation, and time-domain models of gravity perturbations from atmospheric and seismic point sources. Our understanding of terrestrial gravity fluctuations will have great impact on the future development of GW detectors and high-precision gravimetry in general, and many open questions need to be answered still as emphasized in this article.

abstract = {Irregularities in the Earth's ionosphere can make the amplitude and phase of radio signals fluctuate rapidly, which is known as ionospheric scintillation. Severe ionospheric scintillation could affect the performance of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Currently, the Multiple Phase Screen (MPS) technique is widely used in solving problems caused by weak and strong scintillations. Considering that Southern China is mainly located in the area where moderate and intense scintillation occur frequently, this paper built a model based on the MPS technique and discussed the scintillation impacts on China's BeiDou navigation system. By using the BeiDou B1I signal, this paper analyzed the scintillation effects on the receiver, which includes the acquisition and tracking process. For acquisition process, this paper focused on the correlation peak and acquisition probability. For the tracking process, this paper focused on the carrier tracking loop and the code tracking loop. Simulation results show that under high scintillation intensity, the phase fluctuation could be −1.13 ± 0.087 rad to 1.40 ± 0.087 rad and the relative amplitude fluctuation could be −10 dB to 8 dB. As the scintillation intensity increased, the average correlation peak would decrease more than 8%, which could thus degrade acquisition performance. On the other hand, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is comparatively lower, the influence of strong scintillation on the phase locked loop (PLL) is much higher than that of weak scintillation. As the scintillation becomes more intense, PLL variance could consequently results in an error of more than 2.02 cm in carrier-phase based ranging. In addition, the delay locked loop (DLL) simulation results indicated that the pseudo-range error caused by strong scintillation could be more than 4 m and the consequent impact on positioning accuracy could be more than 6 m.},

abstract = {Data assimilation algorithms combine a numerical model with observations in a quantitative way. For an optimal combination either variational minimization algorithms or ensemble-based estimation methods are applied. The computations of a data assimilation application are usually far more costly than a pure model integration. To cope with the large computational costs, a good scalability of the assimilation program is required. The ensemble-based methods have been shown to exhibit a particularly good scalability due to the natural parallelism inherent in the integration of an ensemble of model states. However, also the scalability of the estimation method - commonly based on the Kalman filter - is important. This study discusses implementation strategies for ensemble-based filter algorithms. Particularly efficient is a strong coupling between the model and the assimilation algorithm into a single executable program. The coupling can be performed with minimal changes to the numerical model itself and leads to a model with data assimilation extension. The scalability of the data assimilation system is examined using the example of an implementation of an ocean circulation model with the parallel data assimilation framework (PDAF) into which synthetic sea surface height data are assimilated. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The European Space Agency's Gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer mission (GOCE) was launched on 17 March 2009. As the first of the Earth Explorer family of satellites within the Agency's Living Planet Programme, it is aiming at a better understanding of the Earth system. The mission objective of GOCE is the determination of the Earth's gravity field and geoid with high accuracy and maximum spatial resolution. The geoid, combined with the de facto mean ocean surface derived from twenty-odd years of satellite radar altimetry, yields the global dynamic ocean topography. It serves ocean circulation and ocean transport studies and sea level research. GOCE geoid heights allow the conversion of global positioning system (GPS) heights to high precision heights above sea level. Gravity anomalies and also gravity gradients from GOCE are used for gravity-to-density inversion and in particular for studies of the Earth's lithosphere and upper mantle. GOCE is the first-ever satellite to carry a gravitational gradiometer, and in order to achieve its challenging mission objectives the satellite embarks a number of world-first technologies. In essence the spacecraft together with its sensors can be regarded as a spaceborne gravimeter. In this work, we describe the mission and the way it is operated and exploited in order to make available the best-possible measurements of the Earth gravity field. The main lessons learned from the first 19 months in orbit are also provided, in as far as they affect the quality of the science data products and therefore are of specific interest for GOCE data users.},

@article{Gerlach2013,
abstract = {One of the main objectives of ESA's Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation mission GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation mission, 1999) is to allow global unification of height systems by directly providing potential differences between benchmarks in different height datum zones. In other words, GOCE provides a globally consistent and unbiased geoid. If this information is combined with ellipsoidal (derived from geodetic space techniques) and physical heights (derived from leveling/gravimetry) at the same benchmarks, datum offsets between the datum zones can be determined and all zones unified. The expected accuracy of GOCE is around 2–3 cm up to spherical harmonic degree n max ≈ 200. The omission error above this degree amounts to about 30 cm which cannot be neglected. Therefore, terrestrial residual gravity anomalies are necessary to evaluate the medium and short wavelengths of the geoid, i.e. one has to solve the Geodetic Boundary Value Problem (GBVP). The theory of height unification by the GBVP approach is well developed, see e.g. Colombo (A World Vertical Network. Report 296, Department of Geodetic Science and Surveying, 1980) or Rummel and Teunissen (Bull Geod 62:477–498, 1988). Thereby, it must be considered that terrestrial gravity anomalies referring to different datum zones are biased due to the respective datum offsets. Consequently, the height reference surface of a specific datum zone deviates from the unbiased geoid not only due to its own datum offset (direct bias term) but is also indirectly affected by the integration of biased gravity anomalies. The latter effect is called the indirect bias term and it considerably complicates the adjustment model for global height unification. If no satellite based gravity model is employed, this error amounts to about the same size as the datum offsets, i.e. 1–2 m globally. We show that this value decreases if a satellite-only gravity model is used. Specifically for GOCE with n max ≈ 200, the error can be expected not to exceed the level of 1 cm, allowing the effect to be neglected in practical height unification. The results are supported by recent findings by Gatti et al. (J Geod, 2012).},

abstract = {Since early 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellite mission provide the scientific community with accurate monthly maps of the Earth's gravity field. On short time-scale, the observed variations are mainly related to a redistribution of water on the Earth's surface. This new data set has lead to a leap forward in our understanding of the various components of the Earth's water cycle, and their mutual interaction. The GRACE data provided by the science teams are contaminated by noise, hampering the interpretation of the observations. The first part of this thesis describes a statistical filtering method which removes the majority of the noise and allows utilization of the GRACE data at their full potential. Using the filtered observations, variations in the water budget of the climate system have been studied. A method was developed to obtain a picture of the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet at a regional scale. From the research in this dissertations, it shows that Greenland lost about 200 cubic kilometers of ice each year on average between 2003 and 2008, causing a global mean rise of sea level by 0.5 mm/yr. An acceleration of the thinning of the ice sheet is observed, with a contribution of 0.75 mm/yr to global mean sea level rise in the last two years. Furthermore, the GRACE observations have been used to identify the seasonal exchange of roughly three thousand gigatons of water between land and ocean, and, in combination with sea level measurements from altimeter satellites, to constrain the cycle in heat content of the ocean. Finally, a method was developed to model the passive adjustment of the sea level to changes in the gravity field of the earth, induced by mass redistribution on the continents. Including this 'selfgravitation effect' into numerical ocean model would result in a better agreement between modeled and observational ocean data in several regions.},

abstract = {The dynamics of Earth's mantle are not well known. Deciphering mantle flow patterns requires an understanding of the global distribution of mantle density. Seismic tomography has been used to derive mantle density distributions, but converting seismic velocities into densities is not straightforward. Here we show that data from the GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) mission can be used to probe our planet's deep mass structure. We construct global anomaly maps of the Earth's gravitational gradients at satellite altitude and use a sensitivity analysis to show that these gravitational gradients image the geometry of mantle mass down to mid-mantle depths. Our maps highlight north–south-elongated gravity gradient anomalies over Asia and America that follow a belt of ancient subduction boundaries, as well as gravity gradient anomalies over the central Pacific Ocean and south of Africa that coincide with the locations of deep mantle plumes. We interpret these anomalies as sinking tectonic plates and convective instabilities between 1,000 and 2,500 km depth, consistent with seismic tomography results. Along the former Tethyan Margin, our data also identify an east–west-oriented mass anomaly likely in the upper mantle. We suggest that by combining gravity gradients with seismic and geodynamic data, an integrated dynamic model for Earth can be achieved.},

abstract = {Three GOCE-based gravity field solutions have been computed by ESA's high-level processing facility and were released to the user community. All models are accompanied by variance-covariance information resulting either from the least squares procedure or a Monte-Carlo approach. In order to obtain independent external quality parameters and to assess the current performance of these models, a set of independent tests based on satellite orbit determination and geoid comparisons is applied. Both test methods can be regarded as complementary because they either investigate the performance in the long wavelength spectral domain (orbit determination) or in the spatial domain (geoid comparisons). The test procedure was applied to the three GOCE gravity field solutions and to a number of selected pre-launch models for comparison. Orbit determination results suggest, that a pure GOCE gravity field model does not outperform the multi-year GRACE gravity field solutions. This was expected as GOCE is designed to improve the determination of the medium to high frequencies of the Earth gravity field (in the range of degree and order 50 to 200). Nevertheless, in case of an optimal combination of GOCE and GRACE data, orbit determination results should not deteriorate. So this validation procedure can also be used for testing the optimality of the approach adopted for producing combined GOCE and GRACE models. Results from geoid comparisons indicate that with the 2 months of GOCE data a significant improvement in the determination of the spherical harmonic spectrum of the global gravity field between degree 50 and 200 can be reached. Even though the ultimate mission goal has not yet been reached, especially due to the limited time span of used GOCE data (only 2 months), it was found that existing satellite-only gravity field models, which are based on 7 years of GRACE data, can already be enhanced in terms of spatial resolution. It is expected that with the accumulation of more GOCE data the gravity field model resolution and quality can be further enhanced, and the GOCE mission goal of 1-2 cm geoid accuracy with 100 km spatial resolution can be achieved.},

abstract = {Measuring snow depth using the GPS interferometric reflectometry is an active microwave remote sensing technique and an emerging approach because of its relatively large spatial coverage and high temporal sampling capability. The current geodetic GPS networks are capable of measuring snow depth in the vicinity of the antenna installation at no additional hardware cost. However, the performance is constrained by the geodetic GPS antenna which was originally designed to minimize the reception of the reflected signal. In our prior work, we proposed a horizontally polarized antenna which has equal gain for both direct and reflected signals and tested its performance for a single snow event. In order to comprehensively assess its performance, we set up a horizontally polarized snow monitor (HPSM) using the improved antenna at Marshall, Colorado, USA, over the 2013--2014 water year. The data from the HPSM clearly shows that the proposed design has high sensitivity to even very light snowfalls. However, some anomalies are observed from the HPSM measurements, which tend to either overestimate or underestimate the actual snow depth. We explain the observed measurement anomalies by replacing the traditional air--snow single-interface model with an air--snow--soil dual-interface model. The effectiveness of the new model is validated by comparing the simulated results to the HPSM measurements. Utilizing the dual-interface model, we simulate the error curve for snow depth estimation given various snow depths and snow permittivities. The error curve shows that the estimation biases can be observed only for shallow snow with a relatively small permittivity value.},

abstract = {The determination of high-precision orbits for Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites (e.g., CHAMP, GRACE, MetOp-A) is based on dual-frequency tracking data from on-board GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers. The two frequencies allow it to eliminate the first order ionosphere effects. Data screening and precise orbit determination (POD) procedures are optimized under the assumption of the availability of two frequencies. If only single-frequency data is available, the algorithms have to be modified to consider the ionospheric effect. We develop and study different approaches for POD with single-frequency data. Reduced-dynamic as well as kinematic POD techniques using pseudorange and carrier phase GPS data are considered. One week of data in the year 2007 is used to assess the potential of single-frequency POD in different environments by comparing the results with dual-frequency POD for LEOs orbiting the Earth in different heights. Data from the two GRACE and the MetOp-A satellites is processed for this purpose. Moreover, the impact of different data sampling rates on single-frequency POD is considered. For this period with low solar activity a 3D orbit accuracy of 1 dm could be reached for one of the GRACE satellites. It could be shown that it is necessary to have a high data sampling of 10 s or more available when the impact of the ionosphere is high due to low altitude of the satellite or high solar activity. Our study helps to define requirements for GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receivers and POD algorithms for future LEO missions for which only moderate orbit accuracy of about one to few decimeter is needed. {\textcopyright} 2008 COSPAR.},

abstract = {The 2012 Indian Ocean earthquake sequence (Minfw/inf 8.6, 8.2) is a rare example of great strike-slip earthquakes in an intraoceanic setting. With over a decade of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, we were able to measure and model the unanticipated large coseismic and postseismic gravity changes of these events. Using the approach of normal mode decomposition and spatial localization, we computed the gravity changes corresponding to five moment tensor components. Our analysis revealed that the gravity changes are produced predominantly by coseismic compression and dilatation within the oceanic crust and upper mantle and by postseismic vertical motion. Our results suggest that the postseismic positive gravity and the postseismic uplift measured with GPS within the coseismic compressional quadrant are best fit by ongoing uplift associated with viscoelastic mantle relaxation. Our study demonstrates that the GRACE data are suitable for analyzing strike-slip earthquakes as small as Minfw/inf 8.2 with the noise characteristics of this region. 2015.

abstract = {Radio occultation (RO) has been proven to be a powerful technique for ionospheric electron density profile (EDP) retrieval. The Abel inversion currently used in RO EDP retrieval has degraded performance in regions with large horizontal gradients because of an assumption of spherical symmetry as indicated by many studies. Some alternative methods have been proposed in the past; the global ionospheric map (GIM)-aided Abel inversion is most frequently studied. Since the number of RO observations will likely increase rapidly in the near future, it is worthwhile to continue to improve retrieval method. In this study, both the simulations and the real data test have been done to evaluate the GIM-aided Abel inversion method. It is found that the GIM-aided Abel inversion can significantly improve upon the standard Abel inversion in either the F or the E region if an accurate GIM is available. However, the current IGS GIM does not appear accurate enough to improve retrieval results significantly, because of the spherical symmetry assumption and sparse global navigation satellite system (GNSS) stations used in its creation. Generating accurate GIM based on dense GNSS network to aid the Abel inversion might be an alternative method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The precise GPS high-low tracking data from the joint Taiwan-USA mission FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (COSMIC) can be used for gravity recovery. The current orbital accuracy of COSMIC kinematic orbit is 2 cm and is better than 1 cm for 60-s normal points. We model the perturbing forces acting on the COSMIC spacecraft based on standard models of orbit dynamics. The major tool for the numerical work of force modeling is NASA Goddard's GEODYN II software. Considering that COSMIC spacecraft are not equipped with accelerometers, the accelerations due to atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and other minor surface forces are modeled by estimating relevant parameters over one orbital period from COSMIC's kinematic and reduced dynamic orbits. We carry out experimental solutions of time-varying geopotential coefficients using one month of COSMIC kinematic orbits (August 2006). With the nongravity origin forces properly modeled by GEODYN II, residual orbital perturbations (difference between kinematic and reference orbits) are assumed to be linear functions of time-varying geopotential coefficients and are used as observations to estimate the latter. Both COSMIC and combined COSMIC and GRACE gravity solutions are computed. The COSMIC solution shows some well-known temporal gravity signatures but contains artifacts. The combined COSMIC and GRACE solution enhances some local temporal gravity signatures in the GRACE solution.},

abstract = {The Hilbert--Huang transform (HHT) has been shown to be effective for characterizing a wide range of nonstationary signals in terms of elemental components through what has been called the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The HHT has been utilized extensively despite the absence of a serious analytical foundation, as it provides a concise basis for the analysis of strongly nonlinear systems. In this paper, an attempt is made to provide the missing theoretical link, showing the relationship between the EMD and the slow-flow equations of a system. The slow-flow reduced-order model is established by performing a partition between slow and fast dynamics using the complexification-averaging technique in order to derive a dynamical system described by slowly-varying amplitudes and phases. These slow-flow variables can also be extracted directly from the experimental measurements using the Hilbert transform coupled with the EMD. The comparison between the experimental and analytical results forms the basis of a novel nonlinear system identification method, termed the slow-flow model identification (SFMI) method. Through numerical and experimental application examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for characterization and parameter estimation of multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear systems.},

Recently, requirements have emerged for real-time accurate orbit determination at sub-meter level in order to carry out onboard geocoding of high-resolution imagery, open-loop operation of altimeters and radio occultation. This study proposes an improved real-time kinematic positioning method for LEO satellites using single-frequency receivers. The C/A code and L1 phase are combined to eliminate ionospheric effects. The epoch-differenced carrier phase measurements are utilized to acquire receiver position changes which are further used to smooth the absolute positions. A kinematic Kalman filter is developed to implement kinematic orbit determination. Actual flight data from China's small satellite SJ-9A are used to test the navigation performance. Results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional kinematic positioning method in terms of accuracy. A 3D position accuracy of 0.72 and 0.79 m has been achieved using the predicted portion of IGS ultra-rapid products and broadcast ephemerides, respectively.},

abstract = {Numerical di?erentiation formulas based on interpolating polynomials, operators and lozenge diagrams can be simplified to one of the finite difference approximations based on Taylor series. In this paper, we have presented closed-form expressions of these approximations of arbitrary order for first and higher derivatives. A comparison of the three types of approximations is given with an ideal digital differentiator by comparing their frequency responses. The comparison reveals that the central difference approximations can be used as digital differentiators, because they do not introduce any phase distortion and their amplitude response is closer to that of an ideal di?erentiator. It is also observed that central di?erence approximations are in fact the same as maximally ?at digital di?erentiators. In the appendix, a computer program, written in MATHEMATICA is presented, which can give the approximation of any order to the derivative of a function at a certain mesh point.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a worldwide proliferation of instruments and networks dedicated to observing meteors, including airborne and future space-based monitoring systems. There has been a corresponding rapid rise in high quality data accumulating annually. In this paper, we present a method embodied in the open-source software program «Meteor Toolkit», which can effectively and accurately process these data in an automated mode and discover the pre-impact orbit and possibly the origin or parent body of a meteoroid or asteroid. The required input parameters are the topocentric pre-atmospheric velocity vector and the coordinates of the atmospheric entry point of the meteoroid, i.e. The beginning point of visual path of a meteor, in an Earth centered-Earth fixed coordinate system, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). Our method is based on strict coordinate transformation from the ITRF to an inertial reference frame and on numerical integration of the equations of motion for a perturbed two-body problem. Basic accelerations perturbing a meteoroid's orbit and their influence on the orbital elements are also studied and demonstrated. Our method is then compared with several published studies that utilized variations of a traditional analytical technique, the zenith attraction method, which corrects for the direction of the meteor's trajectory and its apparent velocity due to Earth's gravity. We then demonstrate the proposed technique on new observational data obtained from the Finnish Fireball Network (FFN) as well as on simulated data. In addition, we propose a method of analysis of error propagation, based on general rule of covariance transformation.},

The results showed that strong geomagnetic storms produced effects of varying degrees on the three layers of the ionosphere. Effect of strong geomagnetic storms on the lower layers of the equatorial ionosphere can be significant when compared with effect at the F2-layer. Fluctuations in the height of ionisation within the E-layer were as much as 0 - +20.7% compared to -12.5 – +8.3% for the F2-layer. The 2007 version of the International Reference Ionosphere, IRI-07 storm –time model reproduced responses at the E-layer but overestimated the observed storm profiles for the F1- and F2-layers.},

@article{Blewitt2003,
abstract = {We develop a spectral inversion method for mass redistribution on the Earth's surface given geodetic measurements of the solid Earth's geometrical shape, using the elastic load Love numbers. First, spectral coefficients are geodetically estimated to some degree. Spatial inversion then finds the continental surface mass distribution that would force geographic variations in relative sea level such that it is self-consistent with an equipotential top surface and the deformed ocean bottom surface and such that the total (ocean plus continental mass) load has the same estimated spectral coefficients. Applying this theory, we calculate the contribution of seasonal interhemispheric (degree 1) mass transfer to variation in global mean sea level and nonsteric static ocean topography, using published GPS results for seasonal degree-1 surface loading from the global IGS network. Our inversion yields ocean-continent mass exchange with annual amplitude (2.92 � 0.14) � 1015 kg and maximum ocean mass on 25 August �3 days. After correction for the annual variation in global mean vertical deformation of the ocean floor (0.4 mm amplitude), we find geocentric sea level has an amplitude of 7.6 � 0.4 mm, consistent with TOPEX-Poseidon results (minus steric effects). The seasonal variation in sea level at a point strongly depends on location ranging from 3 to 19 mm, the largest being around Antarctica in mid-August. Seasonal gradients in static topography have amplitudes of up to 10 mm over 5000 km, which may be misinterpreted as dynamic topography. Peak continental loads occur at high latitudes in late winter at the water-equivalent level of 100&#8211;200 mm.},

abstract = {The finite-thrust deployment of a two-satellite formation into a highly elliptic orbit is optimized by means of an indirect approach, which is based on the theory of optimal control. Earth oblateness and gravitational perturbations from Moon and Sun are considered. The optimization procedure provides the engine switching times and the thrust direction during each burn in order to transfer the satellites to the same prescribed final orbit with assigned distance between them at the apogee passage; the total final mass is maximized. A minimum-distance constraint is introduced when required to avoid collision risk. Different deployment strategies are analyzed; in particular, the classical chaser-target approach is compared to cooperative deployment. Necessary conditions for optimality are derived and numerical results presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Authors.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The formation control of a long-distance, drag-free, low-thrust, low-Earth orbit satellite is outlined, in view of future Earth-gravity monitoring missions employing long baseline interferometry (> 10 km) and lasting at least six years. To this purpose, a formation consisting of two drag-free satellites, orbiting at a fixed distance in a sun-synchronous orbit, has been proposed as a baseline. Formation fluctuations are bounded by a box 500×50×50 m. Although at first sight not demanding, the formation control induces non-gravitational accelerations, that are obliged to respect tight drag-free requirements, and are constrained by millinewton thrust bounds. In addition formation fluctuations due to tide forces should not be impaired as their measurement is the mission goal. Requirements are formulated as four time and frequency–domain inequalities, to be suitably parameterized by control gains. Exploiting close-loop Hill's equation properties and asymptotic approximations, explicit design inequalities are obtained leading to a first-trial control design. Simulated runs through a fine spacecraft and low-Earth-orbit simulation dominated by the highly variable thermosphere drag show the first-trial design meets the tight control requirements, and demonstrates mission feasibility.},

abstract = {An accurate knowledge of the ocean mean dynamic topography (MDT) is mandatory for the optimal use of altimetric data, including their assimilation into operational ocean forecasting systems. A new global 1/4� resolution MDT was computed for the 1993&#8211;1999 time period with improved data and methodology compared to the previous RIO05 MDT field. First, a large-scale MDT is obtained from the CLS01 altimetric Mean Sea Surface and a recent geoid model computed from 4.5 years of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data. Altimetric sea level anomalies and in situ measurements are then combined to compute synthetic estimates of the MDT and the corresponding mean currents. While the RIO05 MDT was based on 10 years of in situ dynamic heights and drifting buoy velocities, the new field benefits from an enlarged data set of in situ measurements ranging from 1993 to 2008 and includes all hydrological profiles from the Argo array. Moreover, the processing of the in situ data has been updated. A new Ekman model was developed to extract the geostrophic velocity component from the drifting buoy measurements. The handling of hydrologic measurements has also been revisited. Compared to the previous RIO05 solution, the new global MDT resolves much stronger gradients in western boundary currents, with mean velocities being doubled in some places. Moreover, in comparison to several other recent MDT estimates, we find that the new CNES-CLS09 MDT is in better agreement with independent in situ observations.},

The paper addresses this issue with a twofold purpose. On the one hand, it is an attempt to discuss and assess general concepts, well known in literature, such as achievable resolution, regularization in the least-squares sense or in an infinite dimensional setup, combination criteria, symmetry and block diagonal structures. In particular, as for the symmetry question, a well-defined result, generalizing known facts, is derived. On the other hand, the outcomes of the general discussion are specifically applied to the combination of a high-resolution model (e.g. EGM08) with a GOCE gravity model estimated by the so-called space-wise approach. Small numerical examples are developed to clarify the property of the proposed solution.},

abstract = {A procedure for gravity field determination is presented based on the analysis of short arcs of low flying satellites as CHAMP and GRACE. The analysis technique can be applied to high-low as well as to low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking in a consistent way. The method allows to recover the global gravity field of the Earth, combined with a regional gravity field refinement in regions with rough gravity field features. To detect regional residual signals in the observations a preprocessing step is being applied based on the energy balances along the short arcs. This procedure will be applied as well as the validation of the regional gravity field refinement in a post-processing step. First results are presented by using Post-processed Science Orbits (PSO) of CHAMP for a region with rough gravity field features. To demonstrate the applicability to a tailored low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking experiment the procedure is applied to a GRACE simulation scenario.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that a quasi-steady-state flux of minor bodies moving in and out of the co-orbital state with the Earth may exist. Some of these objects are very good candidates for future in situ study due to their favourable dynamical properties. In this paper, we show that the recently discovered near-Earth asteroids 2015 XX169, 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 are small transient Earth co-orbitals. These new findings increase the tally of known Earth co-orbitals to 17. The three of them currently exhibit asymmetric horseshoe behaviour subjected to a Kozai resonance and their short-term orbital evolution is rather unstable. Both 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 may leave Earth's co-orbital zone in the near future as they experience close encounters with Venus, the Earth-Moon system and Mars. Asteroid 2015 XX169 may have remained in the vicinity of, or trapped inside, the 1:1 mean motion resonance with our planet for many thousands of years and may continue in that region for a significant amount of time into the future.},

abstract = {The annual and the monthly mean values of the land-surface air temperature anomalies from 1880-2011, over both hemispheres, are used to investigate the existence of long-range correlations in their temporal evolution. The analytical tool employed is the detrended fluctuation analysis, which eliminates the noise of the non-stationarities that characterize the land-surface air temperature anomalies in both hemispheres. The reliability of the results obtained from this tool (e. g., power-law scaling) is investigated, especially for large scales, by using error bounds statistics, the autocorrelation function (e. g., rejection of its exponential decay) and the method of local slopes (e. g., their constancy in a sufficient range). The main finding is that deviations of one sign of the land-surface air temperature anomalies in both hemispheres are generally followed by deviations with the same sign at different time intervals. In other words, the land-surface air temperature anomalies exhibit persistent behaviour, i.e., deviations tend to keep the same sign. Taking into account our earlier study, according to which the land and sea surface temperature anomalies exhibit scaling behaviour in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, we conclude that the difference between the scaling exponents mainly stems from the sea surface temperature, which exhibits a stronger memory in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere. Moreover, the variability of the scaling exponents of the annual mean values of the land-surface air temperature anomalies versus latitude shows an increasing trend from the low latitudes to polar regions, starting from the classical random walk (white noise) over the tropics. There is a gradual increase of the scaling exponent from low to high latitudes (which is stronger over the Southern Hemisphere).},

abstract = {A summary of the main concepts on global ionospheric map(s) [hereinafter GIM(s)] of vertical total electron content (VTEC), with special emphasis on their assessment, is presented in this paper. It is based on the experience accumulated during almost two decades of collaborative work in the context of the international global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) service (IGS) ionosphere working group. A representative comparison of the two main assessments of ionospheric electron content models (VTEC-altimeter and difference of Slant TEC, based on independent global positioning system data GPS, dSTEC-GPS) is performed. It is based on 26 GPS receivers worldwide distributed and mostly placed on islands, from the last quarter of 2010 to the end of 2016. The consistency between dSTEC-GPS and VTEC-altimeter assessments for one of the most accurate IGS GIMs (the tomographic-kriging GIM `UQRG' computed by UPC) is shown. Typical error RMS values of 2 TECU for VTEC-altimeter and 0.5 TECU for dSTEC-GPS assessments are found. And, as expected by following a simple random model, there is a significant correlation between both RMS and specially relative errors, mainly evident when large enough number of observations per pass is considered. The authors expect that this manuscript will be useful for new analysis contributor centres and in general for the scientific and technical community interested in simple and truly external ways of validating electron content models of the ionosphere.},

The satellite carries a number of instruments, partly provided by NASA, CNES and USAF, with synergetic use for precise orbit determination, global gravity and magnetic field recovery, and GPS atmosphere and ionosphere profiling. The mission is projected for a five years' lifetime while the orbit slowly decays to below 300 km altitude. The ground segment is run by DLR for mission operations and by GFZ for mission/science interaction, science data processing, archiving and distribution. Ionosphere profiling is a task of DLR.

abstract = {The Level-2 monthly GRACE gravity field models issued by Center for Space Research (CSR), GeoForschungs Zentrum (GFZ), and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are treated as observations used to extract the equivalent water height (EWH) with the robust independent component analysis (RICA). The smoothing radii of 300, 400, and 500 km are tested, respectively, in the Gaussian smoothing kernel function to reduce the observation Gaussianity. Three independent components are obtained by RICA in the spatial domain; the first component matches the geophysical signal, and the other two match the north-south strip and the other noises. The first mode is used to estimate EWHs of CSR, JPL, and GFZ, and compared with the classical empirical decorrelation method (EDM). The EWH STDs for 12 months in 2010 extracted by RICA and EDM show the obvious fluctuation. The results indicate that the sharp EWH changes in some areas have an important global effect, like in Amazon, Mekong, and Zambezi basins. 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Sea level rise poses a significant threat to coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Sea level rise is not uniform globally but is affected by a range of regional factors. In this study, we calculate regional projections of 21st century sea level rise in northern Europe, focusing on the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea. The input to the regional sea level projection is a probabilistic projection of the major components of the global sea level budget. Local sea level rise is partly compensated by vertical land movement from glacial isostatic adjustment. We explore the uncertainties beyond the likely range provided by the IPCC, including the risk and potential rate of marine ice sheet collapse. Our median 21st century relative sea level rise projection is 0.8 m near London and Hamburg, with a relative sea level drop of 0.1 m in the Bay of Bothnia (near Oulu, Finland). Considerable uncertainties remain in both the sea level budget and in the regional expression of sea level rise. The greatest uncertainties are associated with Antarctic ice loss, and uncertainties are skewed towards higher values, with the 95th percentile being characterized by an additional 0.9 m sea level rise above median projections.},

abstract = {An in-depth analysis and systematic comparison of asteroid redirection methods are performed within a resource exploitation framework using different assessment mechanisms. Through this framework, mission objectives and constraints are specified for the redirection of an asteroid from a near-Earth orbit to a stable orbit in the Earth-Moon system. The paper provides a detailed investigation of five redirection methods, i.e., ion beam, tugboat, gravity tractor, laser sublimation, and mass ejector, with respect to their capabilities for a redirection mission. A set of mission level criteria are utilized to assess the performance of each redirection method, and the means of assigning attributes to each criterion is discussed in detail. In addition, the uncertainty in physical characteristics of the asteroid population is quantified through the use of Monte Carlo analysis. The Monte Carlo simulation provides insight into the performance robustness of the redirection methods with respect to the targeted asteroid range. Lastly, the attributes for each redirection method are aggregated using three different multicriteria assessment approaches, i.e., the Analytical Hierarchy Process, a utility-based approach, and a fuzzy aggregation mechanism. The results of each assessment approach as well as recommendations for further studies are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {The hydrological budget of a region is determined based on the horizontal and vertical water fluxes acting in both inward and outward directions. These integrated water fluxes vary, altering the total water storage and consequently the gravitational force of the region. The time-dependent gravitational field can be observed through the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravimetric satellite mission, provided that the mass variation is above the sensitivity of GRACE. This study evaluates mass changes in prominent reservoir regions through three independent approaches viz. fluxes, storages, and gravity, by combining remote sensing products, in-situ data and hydrological model outputs using WaterGAP Global Hydrological Model (WGHM) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). The results show that the dynamics revealed by the GRACE signal can be better explored by a hybrid method, which combines remote sensing-based reservoir volume estimates with hydrological model outputs, than by exclusive model-based storage estimates. For the given arid/semi-arid regions, GLDAS based storage estimations perform better than WGHM.},

abstract = {We investigate the global mean and regional change of sea surface and land surface temperature over 2003–2013, using a large number of different data sets, and compare with changes observed over the past few decades (starting in 1950). We find that over 2003–2013, both global land surface temperature and global sea surface temperature have increased at a rate significantly lower than over the previous decades. While confirming cooling of eastern tropical Pacific during the last decade as reported in several recent studies, our results show that the reduced rate of change of the 2003–2013 time span is a global phenomenon. GMST short-term trends since 1950 computed over successive 11-year windows with 1-year overlap show important decadal variability that highly correlates with 11-year trends of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index. The GMST 11-year trend distribution is well fitted by a Gaussian function, confirming an unforced origin related to internal climate variability. We evaluate the time derivative of full-depth ocean heat content to determine the planetary energy imbalance with different approaches: in situ measurements, ocean reanalysis and global sea level budget. For 2003–2013, it amounts to 0.5 +/− 0.1 W m−2, 0.68 +/− 0.1 W m−2 and 0.65 +/− 0.1 W m−2, respectively for the three approaches. Comparing with the Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) data of the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) project, we find significant agreement at interannual scales. Finally, using 15-year averages of GMST and total ocean heat content rate, we compute the net radiative forcing since 1970 (this start date being constrained by availability of ocean temperature data). Although the uncertainty is quite large because of considerable errors in the climate sensitivity parameter, we find no evidence of decrease in net radiative forcing in the recent years, but rather an increase compared to the previous decades.},

abstract = {It has been widely known that the use of two-frequency Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) system is limited by stringent precision requirements of the range measurements and the proper atmospheric model. Owing to the stringent requirements, this SLR system is impractical for the current requirement of SLR measurements within the framework of global geodetic observing system (GGOS). If in the future this stringent requirement could be met, this SLR system would be an attractive tool to reduce atmospheric propagation effects of SLR and would be of great benefit for the next generation of GGOS design. To anticipate possible future developments of the two-frequency SLR systems, we have developed a new atmospheric correction formula for the two-frequency SLR measurements. The new formula eliminates the total atmospheric density effect including its gradient and provides two terms to calculate the curvature effect and the water vapor distribution effect. While the curvature effect can be calculated by an accurate model, the required information about the water vapor distribution along the propagation path can be calculated using previous developments of optical delay modeling or alternatively using results from microwave measurements. Theoretical simulations using the two-frequency systems of the Graz and TIGO-Concepci{\'{o}}n stations shows that the new formula completely reduces all propagation effects at any elevation angle above 3° with an accuracy better than 1 mm. However, the required precision for the difference of the two-frequency SLR measurements, i.e. better than 45 $\mu$m for a single epoch, exceeds the capability of the current state of the art SLR systems.},

abstract = {Since the successful demonstration of GPS-based Precise Orbit Determination (POD) on TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992, GPS-based POD for Low-Earth Orbiters (LEO) such as the CHAMP and GRACE satellites has become a popular method. The orbit accuracy of GPS-based POD has been improved from 3 cm to 1 cm in the radial direction. In order to achieve higher-accuracy results, it is necessary to understand and try to reduce the impact of various error sources on the orbits. One of them is the GPS satellite antenna offset. Currently, most GPS data processing institutions are using relative GPS satellite antenna offsets, and there are big differences (meter level) between the antenna offsets. In addition, accurate antenna offset values can be only estimated from processing GPS data currently with an accuracy of cm to dm levels. In this paper, we studied the impact of GPS satellite antenna offsets on GPS-based POD using the different offsets. The results show that the antenna offsets have large effects (a few cm) on the GPS onboard receiver antenna estimation and relatively small effects (about one cm) on the satellite orbit accuracy. ?? 2006 COSPAR.},

abstract = {ITRF2008 is a refined version of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame based on reprocessed solutions of the four space geodetic techniques: VLBI, SLR, GPS and DORIS, spanning 29, 26, 12.5 and 16 years of observations, respectively. The input data used in its elaboration are time series (weekly from satellite techniques and 24-h session-wise from VLBI) of station positions and daily Earth Orientation Parameters (EOPs). The ITRF2008 origin is defined in such a way that it has zero translations and translation rates with respect to the mean Earth center of mass, averaged by the SLR time series. Its scale is defined by nullifying the scale factor and its rate with respect to the mean of VLBI and SLR long-term solutions as obtained by stacking their respective time series. The scale agreement between these two technique solutions is estimated to be 1.05 ± 0.13 ppb at epoch 2005.0 and 0.049 ± 0.010 ppb/yr. The ITRF2008 orientation (at epoch 2005.0) and its rate are aligned to the ITRF2005 using 179 stations of high geodetic quality. An estimate of the origin components from ITRF2008 to ITRF2005 (both origins are defined by SLR) indicates differences at epoch 2005.0, namely: −0.5, −0.9 and −4.7 mm along X , Y and Z -axis, respectively. The translation rate differences between the two frames are zero for Y and Z , while we observe an X -translation rate of 0.3 mm/yr. The estimated formal errors of these parameters are 0.2 mm and 0.2 mm/yr, respectively. The high level of origin agreement between ITRF2008 and ITRF2005 is an indication of an imprecise ITRF2000 origin that exhibits a Z -translation drift of 1.8 mm/yr with respect to ITRF2005. An evaluation of the ITRF2008 origin accuracy based on the level of its agreement with ITRF2005 is believed to be at the level of 1 cm over the time-span of the SLR observations. Considering the level of scale consistency between VLBI and SLR, the ITRF2008 scale accuracy is evaluated to be at the level of 1.2 ppb (8 mm at the equator) over the common time-span of the observations of both techniques. Although the performance of the ITRF2008 is demonstrated to be higher than ITRF2005, future ITRF improvement resides in improving the consistency between local ties in co-location sites and space geodesy estimates.},

abstract = {Geodetic satellites have been providing the low frequency part of the geopotential models used for precise orbit determination purposes (e.g. JGM3, EGM96, . . .). Nevertheless they can be used to estimate the temporal variation of selected coefficients, helping to clarify the complex interrelations in the earth-oceanatmosphere system. In this paper we present the two years long analysis of SLR data from the seven available geodetic satellites (Lageos I-II, Stella, Starlette, Ajisai, Etalon I-II) to recover monthly estimates of low degree geopotential coefficients ; the results are obtained analysing the satellites separately and in proper combination. An accurate modelling of the satellite orbits is required in order to separate the geopotential coefficients: we assume as a priori geopotential the JGM3 model together with its associated tides and we take care of non-gravitational effects on the satellites by means of proper empirical estimated accelerations. The time series of the estimated coefficients (.&, J3, J4, J5) are inspected to detect the sub-annual perturbations related to seasonal variation of mass distribution. Huge residual seasonal signals in the orbit of Stella indicate a strong model deficiency related to the Sun's influence on the environment. The remaining six satellites are homogeneously modelled and build up a three cycles per year oscillation on J2 and a seasonal oscillation (1 year and six month periods) revealed on the J4_ The origin and possible causes of these signals are further discussed in the text. We also present a preliminary j2 estimate, using twelve years of Lageos-I and Lageos-II observations, that is compared with previous obtained values.},

abstract = {We investigate the potential of two independent component analysis (ICA) methods, i.e., the temporal and spatiotemporal ICA, for separating geophysical signals in Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data. These methods are based on the assumption of the statistical independence of the signals and thus separate the GRACE-observed mass changes into maximal independent signals. These two ICA methods are compared to the conventional principal component analysis (PCA) method. We test the three methods with respect to their ability to separate a periodic hydrological signal from a trend signal originating in the solid Earth or the cryosphere with simulated and Center for Space Research GRACE mass changes for the time period of January 2003 to December 2010. In addition, we investigate whether the methods are capable of separating hydrological annual and semiannual mass variations. It is shown that both ICA methods are superior to PCA when non-Gaussian mass variations are analyzed. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal ICA resolves successfully the lack of full temporal and spatial independence of the geophysical signals observed by GRACE both in global and regional simulation scenarios. Although the temporal and spatiotemporal ICA are nearly equivalent, both superior to PCA in the global GRACE analysis, the spatiotemporal ICA proves to be more efficient in regional applications by recover more reliably the postglacial rebound trend in North America and the bimodal total water storage variability in Africa.},

abstract = {The Gravity field and steady state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) is the European Space Agency's mission that combines GPS tracking and gravity gradiometry to determine the Earth's mean gravity field with unprecedented, global accuracy with a spatial resolution down to 80 km. This resolution makes GOCE gravity gradient data in particular useful for lithospheric scale modeling. However, the relation between coordinates in a model frame and at satellite altitude is not straightforward, and most geophysical modeling programs require a planar approximation, which may not be appropriate for satellite data. We derive the exact relation between the model reference frame, in which gradients from lithospheric modeling are given, and the local north-oriented frame in which GOCE gradients at 255 km altitude are given. We generated gradients from a GOCE gravity field model and assessed whether the orientation differences between local north-oriented frame and model reference frame are relevant. In addition, we assessed the same for airborne gradiometry at an altitude of 5 km because these data are complementary to GOCE. We find that if the regional area has a longitude extension of 5°, the errors stay below 10%. For larger areas the standard deviation of the systematic errors may be 40% of the signal standard deviation. Comparing topographic mass reduction in planar and spherical approximation, one sees significant long wavelength differences in terms of gravity gradients or gradient-tensor invariants. The maximum error is up to 1 E at satellite altitude compared with maximum signal amplitude of 3 E. Planar approximation is therefore not accurate enough for topographic mass reduction of GOCE gravity gradients.},

abstract = {In this paper, the GRACE Earth's gravitational field complete up to degree and order 120 is recovered based on the combination of different inclinations using the energy conservation principle. The results show that because different inclinations of satellite are sensitive to the geopotential coefficients with different degrees l and orders m, the design of GRACE exploiting 89 inclination can effectively improve the accuracy of geopotential zonal harmonic coefficients. However, it is less sensitive to the geopotential tesseral harmonic coefficients. Accordingly, the second group of GRACE exploiting lower inclination is required to determine high-accurately the geopotential tesseral harmonic coefficients and cover the shortage of the single group of GRACE exploiting 89o inclination. Two groups of GRACE individually exploiting 89+(82-84) inclinations are the optimal combination of the Earth's gravitational field recovery complete up to degree and order 120.

abstract = {Harmonic signals with a fundamental period near the GPS draconitic year (351.2 days) and overtones up to at least the sixth multiple have been observed in the power spectra of nearly all products of the International GNSS Service (IGS), including station position time series, apparent geocenter motions, orbit jumps between successive days, and midnight discontinuities in earth orientation parameter (EOP) rates. Two main mechanisms have been suggested for the harmonics: mismodeling of orbit dynamics and aliasing of near-sidereal local station multipath effects. Others have studied the propagation of local multipath errors into draconitic position variations, but orbit-related processes have been less examined. We elaborate our earlier analysis of GPS day-boundary orbit discontinuities where we observed some draconitic features as well as prominent spectral bands near 29-, 14-, 9-, and 7-day periods. Finer structures within the sub-seasonal bands fall close to the expected alias frequencies for 24-h sampling of sub-daily EOP tide lines but do not coincide precisely. While once-per-revolution empirical orbit parameters should strongly absorb any sub-daily EOP tide errors due to near-resonance of their respective periods, the observed differences require explanation. This has been done by simulating EOP tidal errors and checking their impact on a long series of estimated daily GPS orbits and EOPs. Indeed, simulated tidal aliases are found to be very similar to the observed IGS orbital features in the sub-seasonal bands. Moreover and unexpectedly, some low draconitic harmonics were also produced, potentially a source for the widespread errors in most IGS products. The results from this study are further evidence for the need of an improved sub-daily EOP tide model.},

Particle initial velocities is defined by casual selection realized computer with correspond to given initial velocity distribution of injected particles. We suppose that injection is isotropic and injection velocities are uniformly distributed in given interval in the reference system of injector. The ensemble current state is determined by calculation of ensemble particles locations with the help of numerical solving of the single particle motion equations. These equations take into account that microparticle is influenced by the central gravitational field of the Earth and its perturbation caused by the polar compression of the Earth; force of the solar pressure; the upper atmosphere resistance force and electrodynamics forces.},

abstract = {In this study we present, for the first time, the application of Cryosat SARIn mode data to monitor lakes in mountainous areas and to find their water balance. By applying a novel retracker, tailored for lake level observations, we find at least four useable passes for 125 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and Tian Shan areas over the period February 2012 to January 2014. From these 125 lakes, 30 are passed at least ten times, for which we compute trends and periodic variations, and 16 lakes more then twenty times, for which we additionally apply a water slope correction. This slope correction accounts for geoid inaccuracies or wind effects. We compared the results over two lakes, Langa Co and Bosten, with Jason-2 measurements. Over Langa Co we find an RMS difference of 0.55m, while for Lake Bosten this is only 0.26m. For Lake Bosten, the estimated trends, annual and semi-annual variations from the Cryosat and Jason-2 datasets are compared as well. The estimated amplitudes are comparable, while derived phases differ by a few days. Using the trends of all lakes passed at least ten times, a water volume balance of natural lakes is estimated. A loss of 1.51??0.11km3y-1 is observed in the lakes in the Tian Shan area. In Tibet, a positive mass balance is estimated of 1.76??0.24km3y-1.},

abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are always available, globally, and the signal structures are well known, except for those dedicated to military use. They also have some distinctive characteristics, including the use of L-band frequencies, which are particularly suited for remote sensing purposes. The idea of using GNSS signals for remote sensing - the atmosphere, oceans or Earth surface - was first proposed more than two decades ago. Since then, GNSS remote sensing has been intensively investigated in terms of proof of concept studies, signal processing methodologies, theory and algorithm development, and various satellite-borne, airborne and ground-based experiments. It has been demonstrated that GNSS remote sensing can be used as an alternative passive remote sensing technology. Space agencies such as NASA, NOAA, EUMETSAT and ESA have already funded, or will fund in the future, a number of projects/missions which focus on a variety of GNSS remote sensing applications. It is envisaged that GNSS remote sensing can be either exploited to perform remote sensing tasks on an independent basis or combined with other techniques to address more complex applications. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art of this relatively new and, in some respects, underutilised remote sensing technique. Also addressed are relevant challenging issues associated with GNSS remote sensing services and the performance enhancement of GNSS remote sensing to accurately and reliably retrieve a range of geophysical parameters.},

abstract = {We investigate triple-frequency ambiguity res- olution performance using real BeiDou data. We test four ambiguity resolution (AR) methods which are applicable to triple-frequency observations. These are least squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA), GF- TCAR (geometry-free three-carrier ambiguity resolution), GB-TCAR (geometry-based three-carrier ambiguity reso- lution) and GIF-TCAR (three-carrier ambiguity resolution based on the geometry-free and ionospheric-free combina- tion). A comparison between LAMBDA, GF-TCAR and GB-TCAR was conducted over three short baselines and two medium baselines. The results indicated thatLAMBDA is optimal in both short baseline and medium baseline cases. However, the performances of GB-TCAR and LAMBDA differ slightly for short baselines. Compared with GF- TCAR, which uses the geometry-free model, the GB-TCAR using the geometry-based model improves the AR perfor- mance significantly. Compared with dual-frequency observations, the LAMBDA AR results show a significant improvement when using triple-frequency observations over short baselines. The performance of GIF-TCAR is evaluated using multi-epoch observations. The results indicated that multi-path errors on carrier phases will have a significant influence on GIF-TCAR AR results, which leads to different GIF-TCAR AR performance for different type of satellites. For GEO (Geostationary Orbit) satellites, the ambiguities can barely be correctly fixed because the multi- path errors on carrier phases are very systematic. For IGSO (Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit) and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellites, when the elevation cutoff angle is set as 30?, several tens to several hundreds of epochs are needed for correctly fixing the narrow lane ambiguities. The com- parison of positioning performance between dual-frequency observations and triple-frequency observations was also conducted. The results indicated that a minor improvement can be achieved by using triple-frequency observations compared with using dual-frequency observations.},

abstract = {In this study, for the first time, an attempt is made to close the sea level budget on a sub-basin scale in terms of trend and amplitude of the annual cycle. We also compare the residual time series after removing the trend, the semiannual and the annual signals. To obtain errors for altimetry and Argo, full variance–covariance matrices are computed using correlation functions and their errors are fully propagated. For altimetry, we apply a geographically dependent intermission bias [Ablain et al.(2015)], which leads to differences in trends up to 0.8 mm yr−1. Since Argo float measurements are non-homogeneously spaced, steric sea levels are first objectively interpolated onto a grid before averaging. For the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), gravity fields full variance–covariance matrices are used to propagate errors and statistically filter the gravity fields. We use four different filtered gravity field solutions and determine which post-processing strategy is best for budget closure. As a reference, the standard 96 degree Dense Decorrelation Kernel-5 (DDK5)-filtered Center for Space Research (CSR) solution is used to compute the mass component (MC). A comparison is made with two anisotropic Wiener-filtered CSR solutions up to degree and order 60 and 96 and a Wiener-filtered 90 degree ITSG solution. Budgets are computed for 10 polygons in the North Atlantic Ocean, defined in a way that the error on the trend of the MC plus steric sea level remains within 1 mm yr−1. Using the anisotropic Wiener filter on CSR gravity fields expanded up to spherical harmonic degree 96, it is possible to close the sea level budget in 9 of 10 sub-basins in terms of trend. Wiener-filtered Institute of Theoretical geodesy and Satellite Geodesy (ITSG) and the standard DDK5-filtered CSR solutions also close the trend budget if a glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) correction error of 10–20 % is applied; however, the performance of the DDK5-filtered solution strongly depends on the orientation of the polygon due to residual striping. In 7 of 10 sub-basins, the budget of the annual cycle is closed, using the DDK5-filtered CSR or the Wiener-filtered ITSG solutions. The Wiener-filtered 60 and 96 degree CSR solutions, in combination with Argo, lack amplitude and suffer from what appears to be hydrological leakage in the Amazon and Sahel regions. After reducing the trend, the semiannual and the annual signals, 24–53 % of the residual variance in altimetry-derived sea level time series is explained by the combination of Argo steric sea levels and the Wiener-filtered ITSG MC. Based on this, we believe that the best overall solution for the MC of the sub-basin-scale budgets is the Wiener-filtered ITSG gravity fields. The interannual variability is primarily a steric signal in the North Atlantic Ocean, so for this the choice of filter and gravity field solution is not really significant.},

In this study integral estimators are provided and modified in a least-squares sense to regenerate the SGG data of GOCE from terrestrial gravity anomalies and an existing EGM. Based on the differences between the generated and real GOCE SGG data, condition adjustment models are constructed and variance component estimation (VCE) is applied for balancing the a priori errors of data with these differences. Here, a 1-month orbit of GOCE is considered over Iran and the condition adjustment models and VCE process are used to calibrate the errors of the GOCE data, terrestrial gravity anomalies of the area and the EGM. Numerical studies over Iran show that the a priori errors of the GOCE data and the EGM were properly presented.

abstract = {Mass associated with surface topography makes a significant contribution to the Earth's gravitational potential at all spectral scales. Accurate computation in spherical harmonics to high degree requires calculations of multiple integer powers of the global topography. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the contributions of Earth's topography to its potential to the tenth power of the topography, and quantify truncation errors resulting from neglecting higher-order powers. To account for the effect of gravity attenuation with height, we use series expansions for gravity upward-continuation to the Earth's surface. With degree-2160 expansions, limitation to the first three powers of the topography, as often done in practice, may give rise to maximum truncation errors exceeding 100 mGal at a reference sphere, and ∼25 mGal at the topography. Aiming for a maximum truncation error of 1 mGal we found that higher-order terms to the seventh power are required over the Himalaya Mountains as example of Earth's most rugged land region. Upward-continuation of topographic gravity effects with mGal-precision from the sphere to the Earth's surface is accomplished with a series expansion of fifth order. As a key finding, the accurate conversion of topography to gravity effects at the Earth's surface is governed by two similar yet not identical series expansions. For degree-2160 expansions, we recommend that the powers of Earth's topography be used up to seventh order to accurately evaluate the topographic potential to the mGal-level, as required, e.g., for the construction of high-resolution Bouguer gravity anomaly maps in spherical harmonics.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) is a spacecraft-to-spacecraft tracking mission that was developed to map the structure of the lunar interior by producing a detailed map of the gravity field. The resulting model of the interior will be used to address outstanding questions regarding the Moon's thermal evolution, and will be applicable more generally to the evolution of all terrestrial planets. Each GRAIL orbiter contains a Lunar Gravity Ranging System instrument that conducts dual-one-way ranging measurements to measure precisely the relative motion between them, which in turn are used to develop the lunar gravity field map. Each orbiter also carries an Education/Public Outreach payload, Moon Knowledge Acquired by Middle-School Students (MoonKAM), in which middle school students target images of the Moon for subsequent classroom analysis. Subsequent to a successful launch on September 10, 2011, the twin GRAIL orbiters embarked on independent trajectories on a 3.5-month-long cruise to the Moon via the EL-1 Lagrange point. The spacecraft were inserted into polar orbits on December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2012. After a succession of 19 maneuvers the two orbiters settled into precision formation to begin science operations in March 1, 2012 with an average altitude of 55 km. The Primary Mission, which consisted of three 27.3-day mapping cycles, was successfully completed in June 2012. The extended mission will permit a second three-month mapping phase at an average altitude of 23 km. This paper provides an overview of the mission: science objectives and measurements, spacecraft and instruments, mission development and design, and data flow and data products.},

abstract = {The GOCE satellite mission is one of the main achievements of the satellite geodesy for the Earth's gravitational field recovery. Three different approaches have been developed for the estimation of harmonic coefficients from gradiometry data measured on board of GOCE-satellite. In this paper a special version of the space-wise method based on the second method of Neumann for fast determination of the harmonic coefficients  C nm , S nm   of the Earth's gravitational potential is given based on the radial gravity gradients of the EGG_TRF_2 product, except of two polar gaps filled by radial gradients from the EGM2008 gravity model. In the pre-processing stage GOCE-based second degree radial derivatives were averaged to the regular grid through Kalman static filter with additional Gaussean smoothing of residual radial derivatives. All computations are made by iterations. As the first step the determination of the preliminary NULP-01S   model up to degree/order 220 derived from the Gaussean grid of the GOCE radial derivatives with respect to the WGS-84 reference field was developed based only one of the radial gradients EGG_TRF_2 in the EFRF-frame. In the second iteration the same algorithm is applied to build the NULP-02S gravity field model up to degree/order 250 using the same Gaussean grid with respect to the NULP-01S reference field. The NULP-02S model was verified by means of applying various approaches for the construction of the gridded gravity anomalies and geoid heights in the Black sea area using processing of datasets from six altimetry satellite missions. Comparison of different models with GNSS-levelling data in the USA area demonstrates the independent verification of achieved accuracy of the constructed NULP-02S Earth's gravity field model.},

abstract = {The Rosborough approach was developed in the 1980s for the modeling of orbit perturbations of altimeter satellites. It is a formalism that is rooted in the so-called time-wise approach, in which gravitational functionals are described as an along-orbit time series.Nevertheless, through a transformation of the orbital variables, the along-orbit func- tional can be mapped back onto the sphere. As such, the Rosborough formulation is a so-called space-wise approach at the same time. Both the conventional time-wise and the space-wise approaches have been improved and optimized over the past decade. When we explore the utility of the Rosborough approach in this contribution, we do not expect improved solutions for this particular GOCE-based case study. However, we aim to show the special characteris- tics of the Rosborough approach for processing the GOCE gradiometry data. In particular, we show that this approach can successfully deal with the problems that come with real data like bandwidth limitation and mispointing. Based on the first 71 days of the GOCE gravity gradients, we obtain solu- tions up till spherical harmonic degree 200. Compared to a high-quality gradiometric-only time-wise model, our solu- tion shows a similar performance with just 8 cmgeoid RMS difference in the relevant bandwidth.Moreover, relative contributions from the individual components are provided for the geographically mean gravity gradient components Txx , Tyy and Tzz, and for the geographically variable gravity gra- dient components Txx and Tyy. It is shown that the spatially variable components provide a direct access to understand- ing the mapping of time-variable error effects on the sphere. For instance, the known geomagnetic equator effect comes out clearly in the variable components of gravity gradients, as do track-specific errors. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that the Rosborough approach is a complementary method to the conventional approaches for GOCE data processing.},

abstract = {In this study, we use satellite gravimetry data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to estimate regional mass changes of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and neighbouring glaciated regions using a least-squares inversion approach. We also consider results from the input-output method (IOM) that quantifies the difference between mass input and output of the surface mass balance (SMB) components from the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model version 2 (RACMO2) and ice discharge (D) from 12 years of high-precision ice velocity and thickness surveys. We use a simulation model to quantify and correct for GRACE approximation errors in mass changes between different sub-regions of GrIS and investigate the reliability of pre-1990s ice discharge estimates based on modelled runoff. We find that the difference between IOM and our improved GRACE mass change estimates is reduced in terms of the long-term mass changes when using runoff-based discharge estimates in several sub-areas. In most regions our GRACE and IOM solutions are consistent with other studies, but differences remain in the northwestern GrIS. We verify the GRACE mass balance in that region by considering several different GIA models and mass change estimates derived from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation satellite (ICEsat). We conclude that the remaining differences between GRACE and IOM are likely due to underestimated uncertainties in the IOM solutions.},

abstract = {Recent analyses of long-term time series of ion temperature from two midlatitude incoherent-scatter radars have revealed very strong cooling, which is substantially greater than predicted by models for neutral temperature. There is also an indication that the cooling has substantially accelerated after a breakpoint around 1979 when the ozone hole was discovered. This has prompted a hypothesis that the accelerated cooling might have resulted from the ozone depletion and associated reduction in daytime radiative heating in the stratosphere. A lively discussion on relative roles of different cooling mechanisms has followed. The purpose of this note is to contribute to this discussion from a theoretical and modeling perspective. In particular, a possible misinterpretation of the modeling results behind the ozone hypothesis is clarified. It is also shown that model predictions of neutral temperature trends in the thermosphere agree well with, and hence are tightly constrained by, independent observations including trends in heights of ionospheric layers and in neutral density from satellite drag. However, they are up to an order of magnitude smaller than the observational estimates of trends in ion temperature. These widely different results cannot be quantitatively reconciled regardless of what known cooling mechanisms are invoked. This stark discrepancy should be addressed on the data analysis and theoretical fronts.},

abstract = {The International GNSS Service (IGS) real-time service (RTS) provides access to real-time precise products such as orbits, clocks and code biases, which can be used as a substitute for ultra-rapid products in real-time applications. The true performance of these products can be assessed by the Analysis Centers daily statistics derived from the comparison with IGS rapid products. Additionally, indirect verification is performed by their application to various precise point positioning strategies. Monitoring results and basic descriptions of these products are available at the official RTS Web page (http://rts.igs.org/). We present a more detailed description of RTS products. Information from various sources is collected to provide products application methodology and describe their important features. We provide extended verification of the products using 1 week of real-time correction data. Results are presented separately for GNSS constellations, considering satellite block and type of onboard clock. Comparison with ESA/European Space Operations Centre final products proves the high accuracy of RTS orbits and clocks, which is 5 cm for GPS orbits, 8 cm for GPS clocks, 13 cm for GLONASS orbits and 24 cm for GLONASS clocks. The real-time correction performance is also examined regarding availability and latency. In general, the availability of corrections was beyond 95 % for GPS and beyond 90 % for GLONASS. Since the increasing degradation of product quality with latency is critical for real-time applications, the relation between product latency and accuracy is analyzed. It confirms that high-rate stream update intervals are suitable for the data provided and that the obsolete data should not be used. To avoid this, we propose a method of short-term prediction of RTS corrections that extends the application period of obsolete correction data without a significant loss in orbit quality. Using polynomial fitting, it is possible to forecast the orbit corrections reliably up to 8 min for GPS and 4 min for GLONASS.},

Hydrology variations are from a numerical model, whereas the ice mass variations are based on recently observed rates and patterns of melt for glaciers, Greenland and Antarctica. A eustatic sea level variation consistent to balance the mass variations over land is added. This simulation is then used to test the capability of recovering trends in ocean mass, continental water storage and Greenland and Antarctica melting, using methods used to determine these from GRACE data. We find that ocean mass trends can be significantly biased low by the large melting rates from Greenland, Antarctica and glaciers, unless data within 300 km of continents is ignored. Any smoothing of the data beyond a truncation to degree/order 60 will also slightly bias the result. Trends of continental water storage and Antarctica mass loss also tend to be biased due to the sea level rise signal leaking into the estimate. Greenland melting rates are not affected.},

Simulation results where the data are contaminated with either typical systematic or stochastic noise show that recovery of the local gravity field down to the level of several mGal is possible.

abstract = {GFZ is responsible for routine calculation of atmospheric and oceanic mass variations which have to be considered during GRACE precise orbit determination and calculation of gravity field partial derivatives. This Level-1B Atmosphere and Ocean De-aliasing product (AOD1B) is made available to the GRACE Science Data System and user community in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients with a maximum time delay of about 3–4 days dependent on the availability of required ECMWF meteorological fields. The spatial and time-variable vertical structure of the atmosphere is taken into account by vertical integration of the atmospheric masses. Oceanic mass variations are derived from a barotropic ocean model (PPHA) which was provided by JPL. The individual atmospheric and oceanic contributions as well as the processing strategy to derive the combined AOD1B product are described in the first part of this paper.},

This technique employs local geometric position corrections to reduce orbit errors caused by the mismodeling of satellite forces. Results for a 29-day interval in early 1993 are evaluated through postfit residuals and formal errors, comparison with GPS and laser/DORIS dynamic solutions, comparisons on 6-hr overlaps of adjacent 30-hr data arcs, altimetry closure and crossover analysis. Reduced dynamic orbits yield slightly better crossover agreement than other techniques and appear to be accurate in altitude to about 3 cm RMS.},

@article{Maier2012a,
abstract = {In the framework of satellite-only gravity field modeling, satellite laser ranging (SLR) data is typically exploited to recover long-wavelength features. This contribution provides a detailed discussion of the SLR component of GOCO02S, the latest release of combined models within the GOCO series. Over a period of five years (January 2006 to December 2010), observations to LAGEOS-1, LAGEOS-2, Ajisai, Stella, and Starlette were analyzed. We conducted a series of closed-loop simulations and found that estimating monthly sets of spherical harmonic coefficients beyond degree five leads to exceedingly ill-posed normal equation systems. Therefore, we adopted degree five as the spectral resolution for real data analysis. We compared our monthly coefficient estimates of degree two with SLR and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) time series provided by the Center for Space Research (CSR) at Austin, Texas. Significant deviations in C 20 were noted between SLR and GRACE; the agreement is better for the non-zonal coefficients. Fitting sinusoids together with a linear trend to our C 20 time series yielded a rate of (-1.75 ± 0.6) × 10 -11/yr; this drift is equivalent to a geoid change from pole to equator of 0.35 ± 0.12 mm/yr or an apparent Greenland mass loss of 178.5 ± 61.2 km 3/yr. The mean of all monthly solutions, averaged over the five-year period, served as input for the satellite-only model GOCO02S. The contribution of SLR to the combined gravity field model is highest for C 20, and hence is essential for the determination of the Earth's oblateness. {\textcopyright} 2011 COSPAR.

We show wide track-density variations over time for these orbits in both latitude and longitude, and estimate that geopotential recovery will be as widely affected as well within all these regimes, with lesser track density leading to poorer recoveries.We then use recent models of atmospheric density to estimate the future orbit of GRACE and warn of degraded performance as other low order resonances are encountered in GRACEs free fall.},

abstract = {The Gravity and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite mission measures Earth's gravity field with an unprecedented accuracy at short spatial scales. In doing so, it promises to significantly advance our ability to determine the ocean's general circulation. In this study, an initial gravity model from GOCE, based on just 2 months of data, is combined with the recent DTU10MSS mean sea surface to construct a global mean dynamic topography (MDT) model. The GOCE MDT clearly displays the gross features of the ocean's steady-state circulation. More significantly, the improved gravity model provided by the GOCE mission has enhanced the resolution and sharpened the boundaries of those features compared with earlier satellite only solutions. Calculation of the geostrophic surface currents from the MDT reveals improvements for all of the ocean's major current systems. In the North Atlantic, the Gulf Stream is stronger and more clearly defined, as are the Labrador and the Greenland currents. Furthermore, the finer scale features, such as eddies, meanders and branches of the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current system are visible. Similar improvements are seen also in the North Pacific Ocean, where the Kuroshio and its extension are well represented. In the Southern hemisphere, both the Agulhas and the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence current systems are well defined, and in the Southern ocean the Antarctic Circumpolar Current appears enhanced. The results of this preliminary analysis, using an initial GOCE gravity model, clearly demonstrate the potential of the GOCE mission. Already, at this early stage of the mission, the resolution of the MDT has been improved and the estimated surface current speeds have been increased compared with a GRACE satellite-only MDT. Future GOCE gravity models are expected to build further upon this early success.},

abstract = {What type of gravity satellite mission is required for the time after GRACE and GOCE? Essentially, the variables at our disposal are experiment altitude, compensation of attenuation by differential measurement and measurement precision. The latter depends on the performance of the complete sensor system and involves items such as required dynamic range, baseline length, sensor type (ambient temperature or cryogenic), number of test masses, etc. Before any mission profile is to be studied the science issues to be addressed by GRACE and GOCE follow-on missions need to be clarified. Whether further improvement of the quasi-stationary part of the gravity fields is needed depends on the needs in solid earth physics, oceanography and geodesy and on the availability and quality of complementary data. Complementary data are also the key to the adequate use of measurements of temporal variations of gravity, apart from issues such as spatial and temporal data coverage.},

abstract = {This paper presents a compendium of satellites under civilian and/or commercial control with the potential to gather global land-cover observations. From this we show that a growing number of sovereign states are acquiring capacity for space based land-cover observations and show how geopolitical patterns of ownership are changing. We discuss how the number of satellites flying at any time has progressed as a function of increased launch rates and mission longevity, and how the spatial resolutions of the data they collect has evolved. The first such satellite was launched by the USA in 1972. Since then government and/or private entities in 33 other sovereign states and geopolitical groups have chosen to finance such missions and 197 individual satellites with a global land-cover observing capacity have been successfully launched. Of these 98 were still operating at the end of 2013. Since the 1970s the number of such missions failing within 3. years of launch has dropped from around 60% to less than 20%, the average operational life of a mission has almost tripled, increasing from 3.3. years in the 1970s to 8.6. years (and still lengthening), the average number of satellites launched per-year/per-decade has increased from 2 to 12 and spatial resolution increased from around 80. m to less than 1. m multispectral and less than half a meter for panchromatic; synthetic aperture radar resolution has also fallen, from 25. m in the 1970s to 1. m post 2007. More people in more countries have access to data from global land-cover observing spaceborne missions at a greater range of spatial resolutions than ever before. We provide a compendium of such missions, analyze the changes and shows how innovation, the need for secure data-supply, national pride, falling costs and technological advances may underpin the trends we document.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Zero-difference (ZD) ambiguity resolution (AR) reveals the potential to further improve the performance of precise point positioning (PPP). Traditionally, PPP AR is achieved by Melbourne–W{\"{u}}bbena and ionosphere-free combinations in which the ionosphere effect are removed. To exploit the ionosphere characteristics, PPP AR with L1 and L2 raw observable has also been developed recently. In this study, we apply this new approach in uncalibrated phase delay (UPD) generation and ZD AR and compare it with the traditional model. The raw observable processing strategy treats each ionosphere delay as an unknown parameter. In this manner, both a priori ionosphere correction model and its spatio-temporal correlation can be employed as constraints to improve the ambiguity resolution. However, theoretical analysis indicates that for the wide-lane (WL) UPD retrieved from L1/L2 ambiguities to benefit from this raw observable approach, high precision ionosphere correction of better than 0.7 total electron content unit (TECU) is essential. This conclusion is then confirmed with over 1 year data collected at about 360 stations. Firstly, both global and regional ionosphere model were generated and evaluated, the results of which demonstrated that, for large-scale ionosphere modeling, only an accuracy of 3.9 TECU can be achieved on average for the vertical delays, and this accuracy can be improved to about 0.64 TECU when dense network is involved. Based on these ionosphere products, WL/narrow-lane (NL) UPDs are then extracted with the raw observable model. The NL ambiguity reveals a better stability and consistency compared to traditional approach. Nonetheless, the WL ambiguity can be hardly improved even constrained with the high spatio-temporal resolution ionospheric corrections. By applying both these approaches in PPP-RTK, it is interesting to find that the traditional model is more efficient in AR as evidenced by the shorter time to first fix, while the three-dimensional positioning accuracy of the RAW model outperforms the combination model by about 7.9%. This reveals that, with the current ionosphere models, there is actually no optimal strategy for the dual-frequency ZD ambiguity resolution, and the combination approach and raw approach each has merits and demerits.},

@article{Zenner2012a,
abstract = {Short term mass variations cannot be measured adequately by GRACE due to undersampling. Therefore, they are removed from the measurements beforehand using geophysical models (de-aliasing). As GRACE data analysis has not yet reached ultimate accuracy, one presumes that inadequate de-aliasing and geophysical model uncertainties are one possible reason for this. The standard GRACE de-aliasing procedure disregards geophysical model (atmospheric and oceanic) errors, therefore a procedure has been developed to take atmospheric and oceanic uncertainties into account. Thereby, we expect to improve the de-aliasing product and the resulting GRACE gravity field models. As the GRACE results are used for geophysical interpretations, any increase in accuracy will lead to a better understanding of geophysical processes. The paper summarizes the results of this work. First, the standard de-aliasing process as well as the new procedure, which is able to take geophysical model uncertainties into account, is summarized. After the definition of the performed error scenarios, an overview and discussion of the applied atmospheric and oceanic error maps is given. Finally, the impact of the previously defined error scenarios on the de-aliasing coefficients as well as on a GRACE gravity field solution is investigated. K-band range-rate satellite-to-satellite tracking (KBRR) residuals, as an intermediate gravity field result and gravity field solutions based on the applied error scenarios are analyzed. From the results obtained so far it can be concluded that GRACE results or rather KBRR residuals are sensitive to atmospheric and oceanic model errors. Depending on the error structure of the introduced model uncertainties, KBRR residuals could have been reduced. However, it has to be stated that with respect to the current GRACE error budget, atmospheric and oceanic model uncertainties seem not to play a prominent role in the accuracy of current GRACE gravity field solutions. Nevertheless, further and deeper analysis of the KBRR residuals is needed, as (positive) effects of model uncertainties are visible here. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {It is well known that sea level variations exhibit temporal correlation. This is sometimes ignored in the estimation process of the sea level rise or taken into account using a first-order autoregressive model. We have verified that this stochastic model is accurate for yearly tide gauge and sea level reconstruction time-series but it underestimates the real rate uncertainty in satellite altimetry and monthly tide gauge data by a factor of 1.3–1.5 and sometimes even 2. Similar results were found for sea level acceleration. An original finding is that in 13–17 per cent of the tide gauge data, we found random walk which increases the rate uncertainty on average by an additional factor of 3. The estimation errors presented in this research should be added to the other sources of uncertainty, such as the vertical land movement, spatial correlation and altimeter drift, to obtain the total sea level rate and acceleration error.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 SPIE. This paper describes a new mechanical application of the Watt-linkage for the development and implementation of mono-axial sensors aimed to low frequency motion measurement and control of spacecrafts and satellites. The basic component of these sensors is the one dimensional UNISA Folded Pendulum mechanical sensor, developed for ground-based applications, whose unique features are due to a very effective optimization of the effects of gravitational force on the folded pendulum mechanical components, that allowed the design and implementation of FP sensors compact (< 20 cm), light (< 300 g), scalable, tunable resonance frequency < 200mHz), with large band (10-6 Hz - 100Hz), high quality factor (Q > 15000 in vacuum at 1Hz), with good immunity to environmental noises and sensitivity, guaranteed by an integrated laser optical readout, and fully adaptable to the specific requirements of the application. In this paper we show how to extend the application of ground-based FP also to space, in absence of gravity, still keeping all the above interesting features and characteristics that make this class of sensors very effective in terms of large band, especially in the low frequency, sensitivity and long term reliability. Preliminary measurements on a prototype confirm the feasibility, showing also that very good performances can be relatively easily obtained.},

@article{Fritsche2004a,
abstract = {For Earth-orbiting satellites gravitational forces due to the non-uniform mass distribution of the Earth are dominating the orbit and attitude perturbation spectra. Non-gravitational forces are mainly caused by momentum exchange with the spacecraft surface, and they are mostly of second order. The most prominent of these forces originate from the interaction of the spacecraft surface with molecules and atoms of the thermosphere, and from the impact of photons which come directly from the Sun, which are reflected as albedo from the illuminated Earth hemisphere, or which are re-emitted by the whole Earth as delayed infra-red (IR) re-radiation. In contrast with gravitational perturbations, the aerodynamic and radiation pressure effects are difficult to model since they require a good knowledge of the spacecraft geometry and surface properties, and they also require reliable estimates of the molecule and photon particle flux. The concept of the approach described in the present paper is as follows: 1) Generate a realistic 3D model of the spacecraft to be considered, 2) Compute the coefficients of force and torque due to momentum exchange with photons and molecules in a way, which is independent of the real environment in orbit, 3) For a given orbit position, interpolate and denormalise the pre-computed coefficients, using local fluxes of photons and molecules computed for the real environment. In the present paper the spacecraft model generation process is described and the methods used for the coefficient calculations are explained. Two methods are available: A statistical test particle Monte Carlo method and an analytical integral method. The computation of forces and torques in a real orbit for sample satellites will be the subject of a follow-up paper.},

The spacecraft takes advantage of stable invariant manifolds for low-energy ballistic capture. Low-thrust propulsion is employed to retrieve the joint spacecraft–asteroid system. Global optimization methods are proposed for the prelimi-nary design. Local direct and indirect methods are applied to optimize the two-impulse transfers. Indirect methods are implemented to optimize the low-thrust trajectory and esti-mate the largest retrievable mass. To overcome the difficulty that arises from bang-bang control, a homotopic approach is applied to find an approximate solution. By detecting the switching moments of the bang-bang control the efficiency and accuracy of numerical integration are guaranteed. By using the homotopic approach as the initial guess the shoot-ing function is easy to solve. The relationship between the maximum thrust and the retrieval mass is investigated. We find that both numerically and theoretically a larger thrust is preferred.},

abstract = {We provide a detailed derivation of the analytical expansion of the lunar and solar disturbing functions. Although there exist several papers on this topic, many derivations contain mistakes in the final expansion or rather (just) in the proof, thereby necessitating a recasting and correction of the original derivation. In this work, we provide a self-consistent and definite form of the lunisolar expansion. We start with Kaula's expansion of the disturbing function in terms of the equatorial elements of both the perturbed and perturbing bodies. Then we give a detailed proof of Lane's expansion, in which the elements of the Moon are referred to the ecliptic plane. Using this approach the inclination of the Moon becomes nearly constant, while the argument of perihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and the mean anomaly vary linearly with time. We make a comparison between the different expansions and we profit from such discussion to point out some mistakes in the existing literature, which might compromise the correctness of the results. As an application, we analyze the long--term motion of the highly elliptical and critically--inclined Molniya orbits subject to quadrupolar gravitational interactions. The analytical expansions presented herein are very powerful with respect to dynamical studies based on Cartesian equations, because they quickly allow for a more holistic and intuitively understandable picture of the dynamics.},

abstract = {Considerable improvements in the measurement of the Earth gravity field from GOCE satellite mission have provided global gravity field models with homogeneous coverage, high precision and good spatial resolution. In particular, the vertical gravity gradient (Tzz), in comparison to the classic Bouguer anomaly, defines more accurately superficial mass heterogeneities. Moreover, the correction of these satellite-derived data from the effect of Earth topographic masses by means of new techniques taking into account the Earth curvature, improves results in regional analyses. In a recent work we found a correlation between Tzz and slip distribution for the 2010 Maule Mw = 8.8 earthquake. In the present work, we derive the vertical gravity gradient from the last GOCE only model, corrected by the topographic effect and also by the sediments on depocenters of the offshore region at the Peru-Chile margin, in order to study a spatial relationship between different lobes of the gravity derived signal and the seismic sources of large megathrust earthquakes. In particular, we analyze this relation for the slip models of the 1996 Mw = 7.7 Nazca, 2001 Mw = 8.4 Arequipa, 2007 Mw = 8.0 Pisco events and for the slip models of the 2014 Mw = 8.2 Pisagua and Mw = 7.7 Iquique earthquakes from Schurr et al. (2014), including the previously analyzed 2010 Mw = 8.8 Maule event. Then we find a good correlation between vertical gravity gradients and main rupture zones, correlation that becomes even stronger as the event magnitude increases. Besides this, a gravity fall in the gravity gradient was noticed over the area of the main slip patches at least for the two years before 2014 Mw = 8.2 Pisagua and Mw = 7.7 Iquique earthquakes. Additionally, we found temporal variations of the gravity field after 2010 Mw = 8.8 Maule event, related to the main patches of the slip distribution, and coseismic deformation. Therefore, we analyzed vertical gravity gradient field variations as an indirect measure of the variable seismic coupling finding a potential relationship between Tzz and the seismic b-value. These relationships exemplify the strong potential of the satellite only derived models as a predictive tool to determine potential seismic energy released in a subduction segment, determining the potential size of a potential rupture zone, and in particular internal slip distribution that allows inferring coseismic displacement field at surface.},

abstract = {The geodetic twin satellite mission GRACE delivers gravity field models of the Earth of unprecedented accuracy. However, the originally defined mission baseline is not (yet) reached. Among others, defi- ciencies in the gravity field sensor system or the related signal processing could be responsible for the degraded performance. In this work the GRACE gravity field sensor system is subject to an integrated sensor analysis. First, models of the satellites' environment are derived, including models for the direct gravitational accelerations caused by the Earth, the Sun and theMoon and indirect effects like Earth and ocean tides. Among the non-gravitational forces air drag, solar radiation pressure and Earth albedo are investigated. The purpose of this part of the work is to model what the gravity sensor system should 'feel'. The second part contains mathematical models of the individual elements of the gravity field sensor system, the star sensor, the accelerometer,the K-band ranging system and the GPS receiver, to derive an understanding of how the sensors detect their environment. The third part consists of the analysis of the raw instrument data. The real measurement signals are analyzed and the measurement performance in terms of a noise level is derived. They are compared to the model output and the derived noise level to the one specified by the instruments' manufacturers. Finally the processing of the raw instrument data to the level that is used for the gravity field deter- mination is investigated. A main processing step for all sensors is the application of an anti-aliasing low-pass filter. Alternative filters are tested and evaluated against the filter used for the official data processing.

abstract = {Ocean bottom pressure gradients deduced from the satellite gravity mission Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were previously shown to provide barotropic transport variations of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) with up to monthly resolution. Here, bottom pressure distributions from GRACE with monthly (GFZ RL04) and higher temporal resolution (CNES/GRGS with 10 days, ITG-GRACE2010 with daily resolution) are evaluated over the ACC area. Even on time scales shorter than 10 days, correlations with in situ bottom pressure records frequently exceed 0.6 with positive explained variances, giving evidence that high-frequency nontidal ocean mass variability is captured by the daily ITG-GRACE2010 solutions not already included in the applied background models. Bottom pressure is subsequently taken to calculate the barotropic component of the ACC transport variability across Drake Passage. For periods longer than 30 days, transport shows high correlations between 0.4 and 0.5 with several tide gauge records along the coast of Antarctica. Still significant correlations around 0.25 are obtained even for variability with periods shorter than 10 days. Since transport variations are predominantly affected by time-variable surface winds, GRACE-based transports are contrasted against an atmospheric index of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which represents the Southern Hemispheric wind variability. Correlations between the SAM and GRACE-based transports are consistently higher than correlations between any of the available sea level records in all frequency bands considered, indicating that GRACE is indeed able to accurately observe a hemispherically consistent pattern of bottom pressure (and hence ACC transport) variability that is otherwise at least partially masked in tide gauge records due to local weather effects, sea ice presence and steric signals.},

abstract = {In this study, the Moho depth is estimated based on the refined spherical Bouguer gravity disturbance and DTM2006 topographic data using the Vening Meinesz-Moritz gravimetric-isostatic hypothesis. In this context, we compute the refined spherical Bouguer gravity disturbances in a set of 1° × 1° blocks. The spherical terrain correction, a residual correction to each Bouguer shell, is computed using rock heights and ice sheet thicknesses from the DTM2006 and Earth2014 models. The study illustrates that the defined simple Bouguer gravity disturbance corrected for the density variations of the oceans, ice sheets and sediment basins and also the non-isostatic effects needs a significant terrain correction to become the refined Bouguer gravity disturbance, and that the isostatic gravity disturbance is significantly better defined by the latter disturbance plus a compensation attraction. Our study shows that despite the fact that the lateral variation of the crustal depth is rather smooth, the terrain affects the result most significantly in many areas. The global numerical results show that the estimated Moho depths by the simple and refined spherical Bouguer gravity disturbances and the seismic CRUST1.0 model agree to 5.6 and 2.7 km in RMS, respectively. Also, the mean value differences are 1.7 and 0.2 km, respectively. Two regional numerical studies show that the RMS differences between theMoho depths estimated based on the simple and refined spherical Bouguer gravity disturbance and that using CRUST1.0 model yield fits of 4.9 and 3.2 km in South America and yield 3.2 and 3.4 km in Fennoscandia, respectively.},

The mass redistribution in and around the focal region associated with this earthquake was studied using the gravity changes detected by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. After the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and the 2010 Central Chile (Maule) earthquakes, the present study presents the third case of clear detection of coseismic gravity changes by GRACE. The observed gravity changes were dominated by decrease over the back-arc region of &#8764;7 &#956;Gal or less. This reflects, to a large extent, coseismic crustal dilatation of the landward plate. They agree well with the changes calculated with the Green's function for the realistic earth using fault parameters inferred from coseismic crustal movements. The spatial patterns of the gravity changes of these earthquakes are very similar because they are all shallow angle reverse faulting at convergent plate boundaries. We found linear relationship between gravity decreases and seismic moments.},

Knowing this velocity is crucial for evaluating space geodetic observations\nof continental uplift and subsidence in terms of postglacial rebound and sea level rise. We find SLR observations of satellite\nLAGEOS to constrain the X and Y components of the velocity of CM to ±0.4 mm/yr and the Z component to ±0.9 mm/yr. (95% confidence\nlimits, X is in the direction of 0°N 0°E, Y of 0°N 90°E, and Z of 90°N.) The uncertainty in Z is high, so that the estimate\nincludes the independent inference made jointly using site velocities, the rigid plate hypothesis, and models of postglacial\nrebound that the true velocity of CM has a Z component of 0.5–1.0 mm/yr relative to that in ITRF2008. Uncertainty in scale\nrate, an intermediate parameter in the determination of an ITRF, is ±0.36 mm/yr for VLBI, ±0.52 mm/yr for SLR, and ±0.20 mm/yr\nfor GPS. The scale of GPS depends on that of VLBI and SLR, but the low GPS uncertainty indicates that GPS results are, for\nthe first time, unbiased by changing satellite Block types, evidently due to newly incorporated satellite phase center variations.\nGPS constrains the velocity of CM nearly as well as SLR, representing a technical advance given that a GPS satellite is not\na sphere and responds strongly to solar radiation pressure.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.The long wavelength part of the Earth's gravity field can be determined, with varying accuracy, from satellite laser ranging (SLR). In this study, we investigate the combination of up to ten geodetic SLR satellites using iterative variance component estimation. SLR observations to different satellites are combined in order to identify the impact of each satellite on the estimated Stokes coefficients. The combination of satellite-specific weekly or monthly arcs allows to reduce parameter correlations of the single-satellite solutions and leads to alternative estimates of the second-degree Stokes coefficients. This alternative time series might be helpful for assessing the uncertainty in the impact of the low-degree Stokes coefficients on geophysical investigations. In order to validate the obtained time series of second-degree Stokes coefficients, a comparison with the SLR RL05 time series of the Center of Space Research (CSR) is done. This investigation shows that all time series are comparable to the CSR time series. The precision of the weekly/monthly (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) coefficients is analyzed by comparing mass-related equatorial excitation functions (Formula presented.) with geophysical model results and reduced geodetic excitation functions. In case of (Formula presented.), the annual amplitude and phase of the DGFI solution agrees better with three of four geophysical model combinations than other time series. In case of (Formula presented.), all time series agree very well to each other. The impact of (Formula presented.) on the ice mass trend estimates for Antarctica are compared based on CSR GRACE RL05 solutions, in which different monthly (Formula presented.) time series are used for replacing. We found differences in the long-term Antarctic ice loss of (Formula presented.) between the GRACE solutions induced by the different (Formula presented.) SLR time series of CSR and DGFI, which is about 13 % of the total ice loss of Antarctica. This result shows that Antarctic ice mass loss quantifications must be carefully interpreted.},

@article{Ditmar2004,
abstract = {A technique is proposed for Earth's gravity field modeling on the\nbasis of satellite accelerations that are derived from precise orbit\ndata. The functional model rests on Newton's seconld law. The computational\nprocedure is based on the pre-conditioned conjugate-gradient (PCCG)\nmethod. The data are treated as weighted average accelerations rather\nthan as point-wise ones. As a result, a simple three-point numerical\ndifferentiation scheme can be used to derive them. Noise in the orbit-derived\naccelerations is strongly dependent on frequency. Therefore, the\nkey element of the proposed technique is frequency-dependent data\nweighting. Fast convergence of the PCCG procedure is ensured by a\nblock-diagonal preconditioner (approximation of the normal matrix),\nwhich is derived under the so-called Colombo assumptions. Both uninterrupted\ndata sets and data with gaps can be handled. The developed technique\nis compared with other approaches: (1) the energy balance approach\n(based on the energy conservation law) and (2) the traditional approach\n(based on the integration of variational equations). Theoretical\nconsiderations, supported by a numerical study, show that the proposed\ntechnique is more accurate than the energy balance approach and leads\nto approximately the same results as the traditional one. The former\nfinding is explained by the fact that the energy balance approach\nis only sensitive to the along-track force component. Information\nabout the cross-track and the radial component of the gravitational\npotential gradient is lost because the corresponding force components\ndo no work and do not contribute to the energy balance. Furthermore,\nit is shown that the proposed technique is much (possibly, orders\nof magnitude) faster than the traditional one because it does not\nrequire the computation of the normal matrix. Hints are given on\nhow the proposed technique can be adapted to the explicit assembling\nof the normal matrix if the latter is needed for the computation\nof the model covariance matrix. ?� Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Although the analytical solutions for total least-squares with multiple linear and single quadratic constraints were developed quite recently in different geodetic publi-cations, these methods are restricted in number and type of constraints, and currently their computational efficiency and applications are mostly unknown. In this contribution, it is shown how the weighted total least-squares (WTLS) problem with arbitrary applicable constraints can be solved based on a Newton type methodology. This iterative process with quadratic convergence is expanded upon to become a compact solution for the WTLS with or without constraints. This compact solution is then further interpreted as a uni-versal formula for the symmetrical adjustment of the errors-in-variables model which represents affine, similarity and rigid transformations in two-and three-dimensional space. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the constrained WTLS including the first-order approximation of precision and the bias was investigated. In order to substantiate our proposed method's applicability, it was used to solve the affine, simi-larity and rigid transformation problem in two-and three-dimensional cases, where the structure of the coefficient matrix and multiple constraints were taken into account simultaneously.},

abstract = {From the IPCC 4th Assessment Report published in 2007, ocean thermal expansion contributed by ∼ 50% to the 3.1 mm/yr observed global mean sea level rise during the 1993-2003 decade, the remaining rate of rise being essentially explained by shrinking of land ice. Recently published results suggest that since about 2003, ocean thermal expansion change, based on the newly deployed Argo system, is showing a plateau while sea level is still rising, although at a reduced rate (∼ 2.5 mm/yr). Using space gravimetry observations from GRACE, we show that recent years sea level rise can be mostly explained by an increase of the mass of the oceans. Estimating GRACE-based ice sheet mass balance and using published estimates for glaciers melting, we further show that ocean mass increase since 2003 results by about half from an enhanced contribution of the polar ice sheets - compared to the previous decade - and half from mountain glaciers melting. Taking also into account the small GRACE-based contribution from continental waters (< 0.2 mm/yr), we find a total ocean mass contribution of ∼ 2 mm/yr over 2003-2008. Such a value represents ∼ 80% of the altimetry-based rate of sea level rise over that period. We next estimate the steric sea level (i.e., ocean thermal expansion plus salinity effects) contribution from: (1) the difference between altimetry-based sea level and ocean mass change and (2) Argo data. Inferred steric sea level rate from (1) (∼ 0.3 mm/yr over 2003-2008) agrees well with the Argo-based value also estimated here (0.37 mm/yr over 2004-2008). Furthermore, the sea level budget approach presented in this study allows us to constrain independent estimates of the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) correction applied to GRACE-based ocean and ice sheet mass changes, as well as of glaciers melting. Values for the GIA correction and glacier contribution needed to close the sea level budget and explain GRACE-based mass estimates over the recent years agree well with totally independent determinations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Experimental vertical total electron content (VTEC) data given by Global Ionospheric Maps (GIM) has been ingested into the IRI version 2012, aiming to obtain grids of effective input parameter values that allow to minimize the difference between the experimental and modeled vertical TEC. Making use of the experience gained with the technique of model adaptation applied to NeQuick (Nava et al, 2005), it has been found possible to compute IRI world grids of effective ionosphere index parameters (IG). The IG grids thus obtained can be interpolated in space and time to calculate with IRI the 3D electron density at any location and also the TEC along any ground-to-satellite ray-path for a given epoch. In this study, the ingestion technique is presented and a posteriori validation, along with an assessment of the capability of the ‘ingested' IRI to reproduce the ionosphere day-to-day foF2 variability during disturbed and quiet periods. The foF2 values retrieved are compared with data from about 20 worldwide ionosondes for selected periods of high (year 2000) and moderate to low solar activity (year 2006). It was found that the use of the ingestion scheme enhances the performance of the model when compared with its standard use based on solar activity drivers (R12 and F10.7), especially for high solar activity. As an example, the mean and standard deviation of the differences between experimental and reconstructed F2-peak values for April of year 2000 is 0.09 MHz and 1.28 MHz for ingested IRI, compared to -0.81 MHz and 1.27 MHz (IRI with R12 input) and -0.02 MHz and 1.46 MHz (IRI with F10.7 input).},

abstract = {The satellite era brings new challenges in the development and the implementation of potential ﬁeld models. Major aspects are, therefore, the exploitation of existing space- and ground-based gravity and magnetic data for the long-term. Moreover, a continuous and near real-time global monitoring of the Earth system, allows for a consistent integration and assimilation of these data into complex models of the Earth's gravity and magnetic ﬁelds, which have to consider the constantly increasing amount of available data. In this paper we propose how to speed up the computation of the normal equation in potential ﬁled modeling by using local multi-polar approximations of the modeling functions. The basic idea is to take advantage of the rather smooth behavior of the internal ﬁelds at the satellite altitude and to replace the full available gravity or magnetic data by a collection of local moments. We also investigate what are the optimal values for the free parameters of our method. Results from numerical experiments with spherical harmonic models based on both scalar gravity potential and magnetic vector data are presented and discussed. The new developed method clearly shows that very large datasets can be used in potential ﬁeld modeling in a fast and more economic manner.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission to the Moon utilized an integrated scientific measurement system comprised of flight, ground, mission, and data system elements in order to meet the end-to-end performance required to achieve its scientific objectives. Modeling and simulation efforts were carried out early in the mission that influenced and optimized the design, implementation, and testing of these elements. Because the two prime scientific observables, range between the two spacecraft and range rates between each spacecraft and ground stations, can be affected by the performance of any element of the mission, we treated every element as part of an extended science instrument, a science system. All simulations and modeling took into account the design and configuration of each element to compute the expected performance and error budgets. In the process, scientific requirements were converted to engineering specifications that became the primary drivers for development and testing. Extensive simulations demonstrated that the scientific objectives could in most cases be met with significant margin. Errors are grouped into dynamic or kinematic sources and the largest source of non-gravitational error comes from spacecraft thermal radiation. With all error models included, the baseline solution shows that estimation of the lunar gravity field is robust against both dynamic and kinematic errors and a nominal field of degree 300 or better could be achieved according to the scaled Kaula rule for the Moon. The core signature is more sensitive to modeling errors and can be recovered with a small margin.},

abstract = {Tsunami intensity on the Soloviev–Imamura scale is one of the most important parameters for characterizing the overall size of a tsunami generated by submarine earthquakes. Consequently, this parameter is included in both global tsunami databases maintained by the National Centers for Environmental Information/World Data Service (NCEI/WDS) and the Novosibirsk Tsunami Laboratory of the Institute of Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Geophysics (NTL/ICMMG). S. Soloviev made the initial evaluation of the intensities of a large number of destructive historical tsunamis while compiling his two historical catalogs of tsunamis in the Pacific. The Novosibirsk Tsunami Laboratory under the Expert Tsunami Database Project made further determinations of tsunami intensity for the events after 1975. These intensities have been periodically incorporated into the NCEI/WDS tsunami database under the Global Tsunami Database Joint ICG/ITSU-IUGG/TC Project. In the on-line version of the NCEI/WDS Tsunami Database, the data on tsunami intensity are available only for the events prior to 2003. The main purpose of this paper is to extend the temporal coverage of this important parameter for characterizing tsunamigenic events to the present in order to provide researchers with more data for analyzing the temporal and spatial tsunami occurrence. However, of the 164 tsunamigenic events in the World Ocean from 2000 to the present, we could determine the intensity value for only 44 events that is less than 27 % of the total. For the rest of the events (that is, 73 %), the intensity value cannot be determined due to the lack of data on wave heights from the nearest coast. This shows that despite a great improvement in the tsunami-recording network in the Pacific and other oceanic basins during the last two decades, the data for reliable estimates of tsunami intensity are still problematic. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Basel.},

abstract = {The changing distribution of surface mass (oceans, atmospheric pressure, continental water storage, groundwater, lakes, snowand ice) causes detectable changes in the shape of the solid Earth, on time scales ranging from hours to millennia. Transient changes in the Earth's shape can, regardless of cause, be readily separated from steady secular variation in surface mass loading, but other secular changes due to plate tectonics and glacial isostatic adjust- ment (GIA) cannot. We estimate secular station velocities from almost 11 years of high quality combined GPS position solutions (GPS weeks 1,000–1,570) submitted as part of the first international global navigation satellite system service reprocessing campaign. Individual station velocities are estimated as a linear fit, paying careful attention to outliers and offsets.We remove a suite of a prioriGIA models, each with an associated set of plate tectonic Euler vectors estimated by us; the latter are shown to be insensitive to the a priori GIA model. From the coordinate time series residuals after removing the GIA models and corresponding plate tectonic velocities, we use mass-conserving continental basis functions to estimate surface mass loading including the secular term.The differentGIAmodels lead to significant differences in the estimates of loading in selected regions. Although our loading estimates are broadly comparable with independent estimates from other satellite missions, their range highlights the need for better, more robust GIAmodels that incorporate 3D Earth structure and accurately represent 3D surface displacements.},

abstract = {We report the current status of the on-going project aimed at advancing our understanding of a source or sources of the actual long-period comets (LPCs). For the last several years we have developed several new methods and numerical packages to study in detail well-observed LPCs motion. Our main goal is to increase the thoroughness and precision of each step, starting from a sophisticated astrometric observation treatment through osculating orbit determination with different dynamical models, including different formulations of non-gravitational (NG) forces and, if necessary, adjusting the observational interval to obtain the most accurate past (original) and future orbits. Then we trace LPCs motion for one orbital period backward and forward. In this last step, we fully take into account Galactic perturbations as well as the gravitational influence of all known potential stellar perturbers acting during the relevant time interval around present time. At each step, we carefully propagate observational uncertainties by means of replacing each comet with a swarm of thousands of randomly generated virtual comets, all fully satisfying observational constraints. At the current stage of the project, we have determined osculating orbits for over 100 LPCs, some of them in several different variants. We carefully chose an appropriate osculating orbit variant for past and future motion studies and follow numerically LPCs motion up to a distance of 250 au from the Sun, obtaining original and future orbits. To study their motion further, we selected over 90 stars as potential perturbers and included their influence during the numerical integration of cometary motion. Our computer tools are fully prepared to use more stellar data, e.g. from the Gaia mission. We already noticed several important facts: (1) Including NG effects in the process of osculating orbit determination improves significantly our knowledge on cometary past and future motion. (2) In the case of well-observed comets with long periods covered with astrometric data it can be fruitful to obtain original or future orbits not from the whole set of observations but from shorter arcs, e.g. to exclude observations close to the perihelion, where violent NG effects can disturb a comet motion. (3) Taking into account the observational uncertainties for 1/a-distribution of original/future orbits, we produce a detailed shape of the famous 'Oort spike' that fully reflects observational constraints. (4) We found that the significant percentage of LPCs have their previous perihelia deep in the planetary region - as a result one cannot treat them as 'new comets' since they experienced both planetary perturbations and solar radiation heating at least during their previous perihelion passage. (5) The widely used concept of the Jupiter-Saturn barrier should be revised since significant number of LPCs can migrate through it without any significant orbital changes. (6) None of the known stars have changed dynamical status of any of studied orbits of LPCs significantly.},

abstract = {A tethered asteroid sample and mooring system is investigated in this paper. In this system the spacecraft is moored to the surface of an irregular asteroid such as 216 Kleopatra by using a rocket-propelled anchor with a cable. The rocket-propelled anchor is a kind of space penetrator, which can inject into asteroids at high speeds generated by its own rocket engine. It can be used to explore the interior structure of asteroids, and it can also be used as a sample collector. When the sampling mission is done, the sample can be pulled back to the spacecraft with the anchor. Using this method, the spacecraft can be kept in a safe region in which it cannot be trapped by the gravitational field of the asteroid. This work is concerned with the dynamics of the tethered system near irregular asteroids. First, a shape model and gravitational field model of irregular asteroids are built. Then, the configuration and the stability of the tethered system are investigated, and the quasi-periodic motion near the equilibrium point of the tethered system is analyzed. Finally, the non-uniform density distribution of the asteroids is considered. The deployment process and the oscillation of the tethered system in the uncertain asteroid gravity field are simulated using the Monte Carlo method. The feasibility of the tethered asteroid sample and mooring system is proved.},

abstract = {Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) measurements contain information about the spin parameters of the fully passive, geodetic satellites. In this paper we spectrally analyze the SLR data of 5 geodetic satellites placed on the Low Earth Orbits: GFZ-1, WESTPAC, Larets, Starlette, Stella, and successfully retrieve the frequency signal from Larets and Stella only. The obtained signals indicate an exponential increase of the spin period of Larets: T = 0.860499{\textperiodcentered}exp(0. 0197066{\textperiodcentered}D) [s], and Stella: T = 13.5582{\textperiodcentered}exp(0.00431232{\textperiodcentered}D) [s], where D is in days since launch. The initial spin periods calculated from the first month of the SLR observations are: Larets: Tinitial = 0.8239 s, Stella: Tinitial = 13.2048 s. Analysis of the apparent effects indicates the counter-clockwise spin direction of the satellites. The twice more heavy Stella lost its rotational energy more than four times slower than Larets. Fitting the spin model to the observed spin trends allows determination of the spin axis orientation evolution for Larets and Stella before their rotational period becomes equal to the orbital period. {\textcopyright} 2014 COSPAR.

abstract = {A series of dedicated low-orbiting satellite missions have been recently launched or will be launched soon in order to study the Earth's gravity field. The first satellite in the series, CHAMP (CHAlleng- ing Minisatellite Payload), was brought to orbit in 2000 (Reigber et al., 2003c). It is equipped, in particular, with a GPS receiver, an accelerometer, and a star camera. Thanks to that, the satellite or- bit is determined accurately and continuously, and the non-gravitational forces acting on the satellite are distinguished from gravitational ones. The resulting gravity field models reach a 20-cm accuracy in terms of geoid heights up to the spherical harmonic degree 70. The successive satellite mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) launched in 2002 consists of two twin satellites co-orbiting as a formation at the distance of 200 km from each other (Tapley, 1997; Tapley et al., 2004; Wahr et al., 2004). Each of the GRACE satellites is equipped with the same sensors for gravity field studies as CHAMP. Furthermore, the GRACE satellites make use of a K-Band Ranging (KBR) system which allows variations of inter-satellite ranges to be measured with an accuracy of a few micrometers. The GRACE mission increased the accuracy of gravity field determination by more than an order of magnitude in comparison with the CHAMPmission. Furthermore, GRACE is the first satellite mission ever that could observe temporal gravity field variations at a regional scale. The third satellite mission in the series, GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer), will be launched in May 2008. The GOCE satellite will carry a deliberately developed gravity gradiometer for measuring second derivatives of the gravitational potential (ESA, 1999). Additionally, GOCE will be equipped with sensors for precise orbit determination, similarly to the CHAMP satellite, so that the GOCE orbit will also be used as a source of information about the Earth's gravity field. It is expected that theGOCE mission will allow the accuracy of 1-2 cmin terms of geoid heights to be reached at spherical harmonic degree 200.},

abstract = {It is well known that General Relativity (GR) does not possess any non-trivial local (in a precise standard sense) and diffeomorphism invariant observables. We propose a generalized notion of local observables, which retain the most important properties that follow from the standard definition of locality, yet is flexible enough to admit a large class of diffeomorphism invariant observables in GR. The generalization comes at a small price, that the domain of definition of a generalized local observable may not cover the entire phase space of GR and two such observables may have distinct domains. However, the subset of metrics on which generalized local observables can be defined is in a sense generic (its open interior is non-empty in the Whitney strong topology). Moreover, generalized local gauge invariant observables are sufficient to separate diffeomorphism orbits on this admissible subset of the phase space. Connecting the construction with the notion of differential invariants, gives a general scheme for defining generalized local gauge invariant observables in arbitrary gauge theories, which happens to agree with well-known results for Maxwell and Yang-Mills theories.},

@article{Hay2015a,
abstract = {Estimating and accounting for twentieth-century global mean sea-level (GMSL) rise is critical to characterizing current and future human-induced sea-level change. Several previous analyses of tide gauge records1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6—employing different methods to accommodate the spatial sparsity and temporal incompleteness of the data and to constrain the geometry of long-term sea-level change—have concluded that GMSL rose over the twentieth century at a mean rate of 1.6 to 1.9 millimetres per year. Efforts to account for this rate by summing estimates of individual contributions from glacier and ice-sheet mass loss, ocean thermal expansion, and changes in land water storage fall significantly short in the period before 19907. The failure to close the budget of GMSL during this period has led to suggestions that several contributions may have been systematically underestimated8. However, the extent to which the limitations of tide gauge analyses have affected estimates of the GMSL rate of change is unclear. Here we revisit estimates of twentieth-century GMSL rise using probabilistic techniques9, 10 and find a rate of GMSL rise from 1901 to 1990 of 1.2 ± 0.2 millimetres per year (90% confidence interval). Based on individual contributions tabulated in the Fifth Assessment Report7 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this estimate closes the twentieth-century sea-level budget. Our analysis, which combines tide gauge records with physics-based and model-derived geometries of the various contributing signals, also indicates that GMSL rose at a rate of 3.0 ± 0.7 millimetres per year between 1993 and 2010, consistent with prior estimates from tide gauge records4. The increase in rate relative to the 1901–90 trend is accordingly larger than previously thought; this revision may affect some projections11 of future sea-level rise.},

abstract = {GNSS kinematic techniques are capable of providing precise coordinates in extremely short observation time-span. These methods usually determine the coordinates of an unknown station with respect to a reference one. To enhance the precision, accuracy, reliability and integrity of the estimated unknown parameters, GNSS kinematic equations are to be augmented by possible constraints. Such constraints could be derived from the geometric relation of the receiver positions in motion. This contribution presents the formulation of the constrained kinematic global navigation satellite systems positioning. Constraints effectively restrict the definition domain of the unknown parameters from the three-dimensional space to a subspace defined by the equation of motion. To test the concept of the constrained kinematic positioning method, the equation of a circle is employed as a constraint. A device capable of moving on a circle was made and the observations from 11 positions on the circle were analyzed. Relative positioning was conducted by considering the center of the circle as the reference station. The equation of the receiver's motion was rewritten in the ECEF coordinates system. A special attention is drawn onto how a constraint is applied to kinematic positioning. Implementing the constraint in the positioning process provides much more precise results compared to the unconstrained case. This has been verified based on the results obtained from the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters and the empirical results using kinematic positioning samples as well. The theoretical standard deviations of the horizontal components are reduced by a factor ranging from 1.24 to 2.64. The improvement on the empirical standard deviation of the horizontal components ranges from 1.08 to 2.2.},

abstract = {The GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission relies on the inter-satellite K-band microwave ranging (KBR) observations. We investigate systematic errors that are present in the Level-1B KBR data, namely in the geometric correction. This correction converts the original ranging observation (between the two KBR antennas phase centers) into an observation between the two satellites' centers of mass. It is computed from data on the precise alignment between both satellites, that is, between the lines joining the center of mass and the antenna phase center of either satellite. The Level-1B data used to determine this alignment exhibit constant biases as large as 1–2 mrad in terms of pitch and yaw alignment angles. These biases induce non-constant errors in the Level-1B geometric correction. While the precise origin of the biases remains to be identified, we are able to estimate and reduce them in a re-calibration approach. This significantly improves time-variable gravity field solutions based on the CNES/GRGS processing strategy. Empirical assessments indicate that the systematic KBR data errors have previously induced gravity field errors on the level of 6–11 times the so-called GRACE baseline error level. The zonal coefficients (from degree 14) are particularly affected. The re-calibration reduces their rms errors by about 50%. As examples for geophysical inferences, the improvement enhances agreement between mass variations observed by GRACE and in-situ ocean bottom pressure observations. The improvement also importantly affects estimates of inter-annual mass variations of the Antarctic ice sheet.},

Given that debris impacts occur on a line of intersection between debris and satellites orbital planes, a couple of debris orbital parameters, right ascension of the ascending node, inclination, and nodal regression rate can be determined by impact times and locations measured from more than two satellites in different earth orbits. This paper proves that unique solution for the debris orbital parameters is obtained from the measurement data, and derives a computational scheme to estimate them. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is finally demonstrated by a simulation test, in which measurement data are obtained from a numerical simulation considering realistic debris' and satellites' orbits.},

The comparison of the hydrological model with GRACE reveals temporal inconsistencies between both data sets. Because the LEW model has been calibrated and validated with independent data sources, we believe that this is a GRACE artifact. The within-month ground track coverage shows an irregular orbit behavior which may well cause aliasing in the GRACE monthly deconvolutions.

abstract = {Harmonic analysis of cross-calibrated multi-mission altimetry data has been used to derive a new empirical global ocean tide model, EOT08a. In general, observing di- urnal and semidiurnal ocean tides by satellite altimetry with repeat cycles of 10 (17 or 35) days causes severe alias effects - with solar constituents not at all visible from altimeters with sun-synchronous orbits. However, the combined altimeter time series of TOPEX and Jason1 and of TOPEX-EM, the extended mission on its shifted ground track, provide data periods, long enough to resolve and separate all major tidal con- stituents. Additional time series from ERS2, ENVISAT, and GFO further improve the spatial resolution and allow a sufficient decorrelation of major constituents anal- ysed on a dense equidistant grid. Bottom pressure records are used as independent data to validate the new model and the reduction of variances of crossover differ- ences are taken as a measure for enhancements. Compared to other state-of-the-art models, EOT08a show essential improvements in particular in shallow water. Even in deep ocean some large scale pattern with low residual tidal signals are evident. Thus, EOT08a has the potential to improve the de-aliasing for GRACE gravity field modelling.},

abstract = {Gravity missions are equipped with onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers for precise orbit determination (POD) and for the extraction of the long wavelength part of the Earth's gravity field. As positions of low Earth orbiters (LEOs) may be determined from GPS measurements at each observation epoch by geometric means only, it is attractive to derive such kinematic positions in a first step and to use them in a second step as pseudo-observations for gravity field determination. The drawback of not directly using the original GPS measurements is, however, that kinematic positions are correlated due to the ambiguities in the GPS carrier phase observations, which in principle requires covariance information be taken into account. We use GRACE data to show that dynamic or reduced-dynamic orbit parameters are not optimally reconstructed from kinematic positions when only taking epoch-wise covariance information into account, but that essentially the same orbit quality can be achieved as when directly using the GPS measurements, if correlations in time are taken into account over sufficiently long intervals. For orbit reconstruction covariances have to be considered up to one revolution period to avoid ambiguity-induced variations of kinematic positions being erroneously interpreted as orbital variations. For gravity field recovery the advantage is, however, not very pronounced.},

abstract = {The integration of the Chinese BDS with other systems, such as the American GPS, makes precise RTK positioning possible with low-cost receivers. We investigate the performance of low-cost ublox receivers, which cost a few hundred USDs, while making use of L1 GPS + B1 BDS data in Dunedin, New Zealand. Comparisons will be made to L1 + L2 GPS and survey-grade receivers which cost several thousand USDs. The least-squares variance component estimation procedure is used to determine the code and phase variances and covariances of the receivers and thus formulate a realistic stochastic model. Otherwise, the ambiguity resolution and hence positioning performance would deteriorate. For the same reasons, the existence of receiver-induced time correlation is also investigated. The low-cost RTK performance is then evaluated by formal and empirical ambiguity success rates and positioning precisions. It will be shown that the code and phase precision of the low-cost receivers can be significantly improved by using survey-grade antennas, since they have better signal reception and multipath suppression abilities in comparison with low-cost patch antennas. It will also be demonstrated that the low-cost receivers can achieve competitive ambiguity resolution and positioning performance to survey-grade dual-frequency GPS receivers},

abstract = {Regional height systems do not refer to a common equipotential surface, such as the geoid. They are usually referred to the mean sea level at a reference tide gauge. As mean sea level varies (by ±1 to 2 m) from place to place and from continent to continent each tide gauge has an unknown bias with respect to a common reference surface, whose determination is what the height datum problem is concerned with. This paper deals with this problem, in connection to the availability of satellite gravity missions data. Since biased heights enter into the computation of terrestrial gravity anomalies, which in turn are used for geoid determination, the biases enter as secondary or indirect effect also in such a geoid model. In contrast to terrestrial gravity anomalies, gravity and geoid models derived from satellite gravity missions, and in particular GRACE and GOCE, do not suffer from those inconsistencies. Those models can be regarded as unbiased. After a review of the mathematical formulation of the problem, the paper examines two alternative approaches to its solution. The first one compares the gravity potential coefficients in the range of degrees from 100 to 200 of an unbiased gravity field from GOCE with those of the combined model EGM2008, that in this range is affected by the height biases. This first proposal yields a solution too inaccurate to be useful. The second approach compares height anomalies derived from GNSS ellipsoidal heights and biased normal heights, with anomalies derived from an anomalous potential which combines a satellite-only model up to degree 200 and a high-resolution global model above 200. The point is to show that in this last combination the indirect effects of the height biases are negligible. To this aim, an error budget analysis is performed. The biases of the high frequency part are proved to be irrelevant, so that an accuracy of 5 cm per individual GNSS station is found. This seems to be a promising practical method to solve the problem.},

abstract = {Two thematic drivers are motivating the science community towards constellations of small satellites, the revelation that many next generation system science questions are uniquely addressed with sufficient numbers of simultaneous space based measurements, and the realization that space is historically expensive, and in an environment of constrained costs, we must innovate to "do more with less". We present analysis that answers many of the key questions surrounding constellations of scientific satellites, including research that resulted from the GEOScan community based effort originally intended as hosted payloads on Iridium NEXT. We present analysis that answers the question how many satellites does global system science require? Perhaps serendipitously, the analyses show that many of the key science questions independently converge towards similar results, i.e. that approximately 60+ satellites are needed for transformative, as opposed to incremental capability in system science. The current challenge is how to effectively transition products from design to mass production for space based instruments and vehicles. Ideally, the lesson learned from past designs and builds of various space products should pave the way toward a better manufacturing plan that utilizes just a fraction of the prototype's cost. Using the commercial products industry implementations of mass customization as an example, we will discuss about the benefits of standardization in design requirements for space instruments and vehicles. For example, the instruments (payloads) are designed to have standardized elements, components, or modules that interchangeably work together within a linkage system. We conclude with a discussion on implementation plans and the new paradigms for community and international cooperation enabled by small satellite constellations. {\textcopyright} 2014 SPIE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd. In this work, the Laser Ranged Satellites Experiment (LARASE) is presented. This is a research program that aims to perform new refined tests and measurements of gravitation in the field of the Earth in the weak field and slow motion (WFSM) limit of general relativity (GR). For this objective we use the free available data relative to geodetic passive satellite lasers tracked from a network of ground stations by means of the satellite laser ranging (SLR) technique. After a brief introduction to GR and its WFSM limit, which aims to contextualize the physical background of the tests and measurements that LARASE will carry out, we focus on the current limits of validation of GR and on current constraints on the alternative theories of gravity that have been obtained with the precise SLR measurements of the two LAGEOS satellites performed so far. Afterward, we present the scientific goals of LARASE in terms of upcoming measurements and tests of relativistic physics. Finally, we introduce our activities and we give a number of new results regarding the improvements to the modelling of both gravitational and non-gravitational perturbations to the orbit of the satellites. These activities are a needed prerequisite to improve the forthcoming new measurements of gravitation. An innovation with respect to the past is the specialization of the models to the LARES satellite, especially for what concerns the modelling of its spin evolution, the neutral drag perturbation and the impact of Earth's solid tides on the satellite orbit.},

This subject, in its present form, began with the 2002 launch of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). GRACE has been providing regular monthly estimates of the Earth's gravity field down to scales of several hundred kilometers. Any process that involves enough redistribution of mass at those temporal and spatial scales is a possible target for GRACE. There are applications for hydrology, oceanography, the cryosphere, and the solid Earth. This chapter summarizes the observational and theoretical framework used to interpret time-variable satellite gravity measurements, and reviews some of the evolving geophysical applications of this technique.},

abstract = {The main objective of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission consists of determining the temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field. These variations are captured by time series of gravity field models of limited resolution at, e.g., monthly intervals. We present a new time series of monthly models, which was computed with the so-called Celestial Mechanics Approach (CMA), developed at the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB).The secular and seasonal variations in the monthly models are tested for statistical significance. Calibrated errors are derived from inter-annual variations. The time-variable signal can be extracted at least up to degree 60, but the gravity field coefficients of orders above 45 are heavily contaminated by noise. This is why a series of monthly models is computed up to a maximum degree of 60, but only a maximum order of 45. Spectral analysis of the residual time-variable signal shows a distinctive peak at a period of 160 days, which shows up in particular in the C 20 spherical harmonic coefficient.Basic filter- and scaling-techniques are introduced to evaluate the monthly models. For this purpose, the variability over the oceans is investigated, which serves as a measure for the noisiness of the models. The models in selected regions show the expected seasonal and secular variations, which are in good agreement with the monthly models of the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). The results also reveal a few small outliers, illustrating the necessity for improved data screening. Our monthly models are available at the web page of the International Centre for Global Earth Models (ICGEM). ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Jiang2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. We are interested in the periodic motion and bifurcations near the surface of an asteroid. The gravity field of an irregular asteroid and the equation of motion of a particle near the surface of an asteroid are studied. The periodic motions around the major body of triple asteroid 216 Kleopatra and the OSIRIS-REx mission target-asteroid 101955 Bennu are discussed. We find that motion near the surface of an irregular asteroid is quite different from the motion near the surface of a homoplastically spheroidal celestial body. The periodic motions around the asteroid 101955 Bennu and 216 Kleopatra indicate that the geometrical shapes of the orbits are probably very sophisticated. There exist both stable periodic motions and unstable periodic motions near the surface of the same irregular asteroid. This periodic motion which is unstable can be resonant or non-resonant. The period-doubling bifurcation and pseudo period-doubling bifurcation of periodic orbits coexist in the same gravity field of the primary of the triple asteroid 216 Kleopatra. It is found that both of the period-doubling bifurcations of periodic orbits and pseudo period-doubling bifurcation of periodic orbits have four different paths. The pseudo period-doubling bifurcation found in the potential field of primary of triple asteroid 216 Kleopatra shows that there exist stable periodic orbits near the primary's equatorial plane, which gives an explanation for the motion stability of the triple asteroid 216 Kleopatra's two moonlets, Alexhelios and Cleoselene.},

@book{Eicker2008b,
abstract = {The analysis concepts are tailored to the in-situ type character of the observations provided by the new satellite missions CHAMP, GRACE, and GOCE. They are able to evaluate data derived from short arcs of the satellite's orbit and, therefore, offer the opportunity to use regional satellite data for the calculation of regional gravity field solutions. The regional character of the approach will be realized at various stages of the analysis procedure. The first step is the design of specifically tailored space localizing basis functions. In order to adapt the basis functions to the signal content to be expected in the gravity field solution, they will be derived from the covariance function of the gravitational potential. To use the basis functions in gravity field modeling, they have to be located at the nodal points of a spherical grid; therefore investigations will be performed regarding a suitable choice of such a nodal point distribution. Another important aspect in the regional gravity field analysis approach is the downward continuation process. In this context, a regionally adapted regularization will be introduced which assigns different regularization matrices to geographical areas with varying signal content. Regularization parameters individually determined for each region take into account the varying frequency behavior, allowing to extract additional information out of a given data set. To conclude the analysis chain, an approach will be described that combines regional solutions with global coverage to obtain a global solution and to derive the corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients by means of the Gauss-Legendre quadrature method. The capability of the method will be demonstrated by its successful application to real data provided by CHAMP and GRACE and to a simulation scenario based on a combination of GRACE and GOCE observations.},

Each model output has been tested against differential slant TEC (dSTEC) truth data for high (May 2002) and low (December 2006) sunspot periods. Three of the models (EDAM, TOMION, and NTCM) produce dSTEC standard deviation results that are broadly consistent with each other and with standard deviation spreads of ∼1 TECu for December 2006 and ∼1.5 TECu for May 2002. The lowest reported standard deviation across all models and all stations was 0.99 TECu (EDAM, TLSE station for December 2006 night). However, the model with the best overall dSTEC performance was TOMION which has the lowest standard deviation in 28 out of 52 test cases (13 stations, two test periods, day and night). This is probably related to the interpolation techniques used in TOMION exploiting the spatial stationarity of vertical TEC error decorrelation. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Thermospheric density and neutral velocity perturbations associated with three magnetic storms in the autumn season of 2011 are examined using data from the neutral wind meter (NWM) on the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS) satellite. The data from perigee passes near 400 km altitude show marked increases in neutral density during the storms and associated increases in horizontal neutral flow speeds. These thermospheric responses are characterized by enhanced meridional neutral flows with peak perturbation amplitudes near 100 m/s and relative neutral density enhancements ranging from 50–100%. The increases in the neutral density and meridional flow velocity at equatorial latitudes occur about 5–7 h after the initial perturbations are observed in the z component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), and they persist for 20–30 h. The perturbations in the neutral density are in good agreement with temperature increases predicted by an empirical model that has been validated using data from the CHAMP and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment missions, with a maximum lag time of $\sim$1–1.5 h between the model temperature increases and the observed density perturbations. The model temperatures are in excellent agreement with ground-based low-latitude temperature measurements during the storms. Ground-based wind measurements during one of the storms provide additional data for comparison with the perturbation wind amplitudes measured aboard the satellite.},

abstract = {A new functional model is proposed for gravity field modeling on the basis of KBR data from the GRACE satellite mission. This functional model explicitly connects a linear combination of gravitational potential gradients with a linear combination of range-rate measurements at several successive epochs. The system of observation equations is solved in the least-squares sense by means of the pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method. Noise in range-rate combinations is strongly dependent on frequency, so that a proper frequency-dependent data weighting is a must. The new approach allows a high numerical efficiency to be reached. Both simulated and real GRACE data have been considered. In particular, we found that the resulting gravity field model is rather sensitive to errors in the satellite orbits. A preliminary gravity field model we obtained from a 101 day set of GRACE data has a comparable accuracy with the GGM01S model derived by CSR.},

abstract = {In the restricted four-body problem consisting of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun as the primaries and a spacecraft as the planetoid, we take into account the solar perturbation in the description of the motion of a spacecraft in the vicinity of the stable Earth-Moon libration points L4 and L5 both in the classical regime and in the context of effective field theories of gravity. We then evaluate the location of all Lagrangian points in the Earth-Moon system within the framework of general relativity. For the points L4 and L5, the corrections of coordinates are of order a few millimeters. After that, we set up a scheme where the theory which is quantum corrected has as its classical counterpart the Einstein theory, instead of the Newtonian one. By virtue of the effective-gravity correction to the longdistance form of the potential among two point masses, all terms involving the ratio between the gravitational radius of the primary and its separation from the planetoid get modified. Within this framework, for the Lagrangian points of stable equilibrium, we find quantum corrections of order two millimeters, whereas for Lagrangian points of unstable equilibrium we find quantum corrections below a millimeter. Finally, general relativity corrections to Newtonian position of collinear Lagrangian points turn out to be below the millimiter, whereas on stable equilibrium points they are of order a few millimiters.},

abstract = {The low spatial resolution of GRACE causes leakage, where signals in one location spread out into nearby regions. Because of this leakage, using simple techniques such as basin averages may result in an incorrect estimate of the true mass change in a region. A fairly simple least squares inversion technique can be used to more specifically localize mass changes into a pre-determined set of basins of uniform internal mass distribution. However, the accuracy of these higher resolution basin mass amplitudes has not been determined, nor is it known how the distribution of the chosen basins affects the results. We use a simple ‘truth' model over Greenland as an example case, to estimate the uncertainties of this inversion method and expose those design parameters which may result in an incorrect high-resolution mass distribution. We determine that an appropriate level of smoothing (300–400 km) and process noise (0.30 cm2 of water) gets the best results. The trends of the Greenland internal basins and Iceland can be reasonably estimated with this method, with average systematic errors of 3.5 cm yr−1 per basin. The largest mass losses found from GRACE RL04 occur in the coastal northwest (−19.9 and −33.0 cm yr−1) and southeast (−24.2 and −27.9 cm yr−1), with small mass gains (+1.4 to +7.7 cm yr−1) found across the northern interior. Acceleration of mass change is measurable at the 95 per cent confidence level in four northwestern basins, but not elsewhere in Greenland. Due to an insufficiently detailed distribution of basins across internal Canada, the trend estimates of Baffin and Ellesmere Islands are expected to be incorrect due to systematic errors caused by the inversion technique.},

abstract = {The upcoming European Space Agency (ESA) Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circular Explorer (GOCE) mission, foreseen to be launched in 2007 (status: July 2006) will carry a highly sensitive gradiometer, consisting of three orthogonal pairs of ultra-sensitive accelerometers. A challenging calibration procedure has been developed to calibrate the gradiometer not only pre-launch by a series of on-ground tests, but also after launch by making use of on-board cold-gas thrusters to provoke a long series of gradiometer shaking events which will provide observations for its calibration. In addition, a number of quick-look post-launch methods has been designed and will be implemented that aim at validating the calibration of the gradiometer instrument and at the same time support the operations of the satellite. These methods are based on (1) comparison with the best available global gravity field models, (2) upward continuation of high-precision ground-based gravity field data over certain geographical areas, and (3) use of GPS Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (SST) observations. The focus of this paper is on the third method. An assessment has been made of how well the gradiometer observations can be validated by a combination with GPS tracking observations of GOCE. It was found by a detailed simulation study that the most important parameters, the scale factors of the diagonal gravity gradient components, can be determined with an accuracy better than 0.004, provided a nominal behavior of the gradiometer and GPS instruments. ?? 2006 COSPAR.},

abstract = {Sensors, and also actuators or external sources such as databases, serve as data sources in order to realise condition monitoring of industrial applications or the acquisition of characteristic parameters like production speed or reject rate. Modern facilities create such a large amount of complex data that a machine operator is unable to comprehend and process the information contained in the data. Thus, information fusion mechanisms gain increasing importance. Besides the management of large amounts of data, further challenges towards the fusion algorithms arise from epistemic uncertainties (incomplete knowledge) in the input signals as well as conflicts between them. These aspects must be considered during information processing to obtain reliable results, which are in accordance with the real world. The analysis of the scientific state of the art shows that current solutions fulfil said requirements at most only partly. This article proposes the multilayered information fusion system MACRO (multilayer attribute-based conflict-reducing observation) employing the $\mu$BalTLCS (fuzzified balanced two-layer conflict solving) fusion algorithm to reduce the impact of conflicts on the fusion result. The performance of the contribution is shown by its evaluation in the scope of a machine condition monitoring application under laboratory conditions. Here, the MACRO system yields the best results compared to state-of-the-art fusion mechanisms. The utilised data is published and freely accessible.},

abstract = {US-Germany co-sponsered satellite gravimetry mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment), launched in March 2002, has been producing monthly time series of Earth gravity models up to degree and order of 120. The GRACE mission consists of two identical satellites flying on an almost polar orbit with an altitude of about 300-500 km and satelite-to-satellite ranging of about 220 km. Thanks to the payloads of space-borne GPS receivers, accelerometers and high-precision K-band satelite-to-satellite ranging mesurements, GRACE gravity models are expected to achieve more than one order of magnitude of improvement over previous models at spatial scales of a few hundred kilometers or larger. Recovery of surface mass re-distribution based on GRACE's time-varying gravity models is applied to studies in solid Earth geophysics, oceanography, climatology and geodesy. At secular time scales, GRACE is expected to provide valuable information on global ice changes, whose variations have profound influences on global climate, and in particular, on sea level changes. At seasonal time scales, GRACE is expected to reveal surface water changes with an accuracy of less than 1 cm, or ocean bottom pressure changes with an accuracy of less than 1 mbar (1 mbar =10(2) Pa). These surface mass redistribution measurements would impove our understanding of the global and regional mass and energy cycles that are critical to human life. Using 15 GRACE monthly gravity models covering the period from April 2002 to December 2003, this study compares seasonal water storage changes recovered from GRACE data and hydrology models at global and regional scales, with particular focus on the Yangtze River basin of China. Annual amplitude of 3.4 cm of equivalent water height change is found for the Yangtze River basin with maximum in Spring and Autumn, agreeing with two state-of-the-art hydrology models. The differences between GRACE results and model predictions are less than 1-2 cm. We conclude that satellite gravimetry has huge potentials in monitering water storage changes in large river basins such as Yangtze.},

abstract = {In this paper the main results concerning the preparatory studies of a future ESA Earth Observation gravity mission are presented: the mission will be ultimately devoted to improve our understanding of the Earth's mass transport phenomena, the temporal variations of the gravity field, at different temporal and spatial scales, being caused by mass changes of ice sheets and ice caps, continental water cycles, ocean masses dynamics and solid-earth deformations. The "Assessment of a Next Generation Gravity Mission for Monitoring the Variations of the Earth's Gravity" study (concisely: NGGM) consisted of two parallel activities followed by two consortia: each one has involved European universities and academic institutions for scientific support and requirement assessments, in addition to experts in mission analysis and measurement technologies. Several mission concepts have been studied with well-defined science requirements and accurate sub-system designs: in addition to the drivers due to tight propulsion requirements and accelerometer calibration issues, the technical constraints on power and fuel may dictate the choice of orbit. Thus, for each considered constellation type, the different interactions between dragfree and "loose" formation control have been analyzed, together with the design of the relative attitude control, necessary to ensure the laser link for inter-satellite distance measurement all along the mission phases. The latest results concerning the proposed satellite architectures, laser metrology, attitude and orbit control system and formation flying control concepts are presented in the paper, together with the on-going activities for increasing the technological readiness level of the main subsystems. A broad overview is given on the status of the miniaturized RIT and mN-FEEP breadboarding and testing for what concerns the micro-propulsion subsystem, while, concerning the laser metrology, the laser head and the laser stabilization device are described at unit level, with a discussion on the thermal requirements derivation.},

abstract = {Recent developments inmascon (mass concentration) solutions for GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite data have significantly increased the spatial localization and amplitude of recov- ered terrestrial Total Water Storage anomalies (TWSA); however, land hydrology applications have been limit- ed. Here we compare TWSA from April 2002 through March 2015 from(1) newly released GRACE mascons fromthe Center for Space Research (CSR-M) with (2) NASA JPL mascons (JPL-M), and with (3) CSR Tellus gridded spherical harmonics rescaled (sf) (CSRT-GSH.sf) in 176 river basins, $60% of the global land area. Time series in TWSA mascons (CSR-Mand JPL-M) and spherical harmonics are highly correlated (rank correlation coefficientsmostly>0.9). The signal from long-termtrends (up to620mm/yr) is much less than that from seasonal amplitudes (up to 250mm). Net long-termtrends, summed over all 176 basins, are similar for CSR and JPLmascons (66–69 km3/yr) but are lower for spherical harmonics ($14 km3/yr). Long-termTWSA declines are foundmostly in irrigated basins (241 to269 km3/yr). Seasonal amplitudes agree among GRACE solutions, increasing confidence in GRACE-based seasonal fluctuations. Rescaling spherical harmonics signifi- cantly increases agreement with mascons for seasonal fluctuations, but less for long-termtrends. Mascons provide advantages relative to spherical harmonics, including (1) reduced leakage from land to ocean increas- ing signal amplitude, and (2) application of geophysical data constraints during processing with little empirical postprocessing requirements,making it easier for nongeodetic users. Results of this product intercomparison should allow hydrologists to better select suitable GRACE solutions for hydrologic applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.We review the measurement of the mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Mediterranean using ellipsoidal heights of sea level at discrete tide gauge locations, and across the entire basin using satellite altimetry, subtracting estimates of the geoid obtained from recent models. This ‘geodetic approach' to the determination of the MDT can be compared to the independent ‘ocean approach' that involves the use of in situ oceanographic measurements and ocean modelling. We demonstrate that with modern geoid and ocean models there is an encouraging level of consistency between the two sets of MDTs. In addition, we show how important geodetic MDT information can be in judging between existing global ocean circulation models, and in providing insight for the development of new ones. The review makes clear the major limitations in Mediterranean data sets that prevent a more complete validation, including the need for improved geoid models of high spatial resolution and accuracy. Suggestions are made on how a greater amount of reliable geo-located tide gauge information can be obtained in the future.},

abstract = {Thanks to the high performance of the spaceborne GPS receiver and the availability of precise IGS orbit and clock products, zero-difference kinematic precise orbit determination (POD) has been turned out to be a new effective method in orbit determination for the LEO satellites. Zero-difference kinematic POD, which is based on the GPS measurements only from the spaceborne GPS receiver, does not depend on the force models and orbit design. From this point of view, kinematic POD is suitable for the Earth observation satellites at very low altitudes, such as CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE, etc. This paper first reviews the basic zero-difference GPS observation model. Then a modified data quality control scheme is put forward. Finally, a block-wise least squares algorithm, which first separates the parameters into several groups and then solves the parameters by elimination and back-substitution, is discussed and proposed for the kinematic orbit determination. With the above algorithms, we developed kinematic POD software to solve the orbit suitable for one-week GRACE observations. Comparisons with the published Rapid Science Orbit (RSO) indicate that, using our approach to determine the orbit, the accuracy in the radial direction can achieve 3–4 cm for GRACE-A, and 3–5 cm for GRACE-B.},

abstract = {The modelling of non-gravitational forces acting on a satellite (especially a GNSS satellite) started half a century ago. Their modelling to low Earth orbiters (LEOs), however, are more recent because of the dominating atmospheric drag, the modelling of which requires the precision of recent atmospheric models. However, this is not an issue for precise orbit determination (POD), as of the method used to compute the reduced-dynamic orbit. The method is using piecewise constant accelerations (PCA), which are absorbing the non-conservative forces that are not modelled. One expects the implementation of non-gravitational forces to reduce the amplitude and mean values of the PCA of the satellite's reduced-dynamic orbit. In this thesis assignment, four non-gravitational forces has been considered large enough for improving the POD of GPS-based LEO using the Bernese GNSS Software: the aerodynamic forces, the solar radiation pressure and the reflected and emitted Earth radiation pressure. For each force, a modelling method has been chosen and implemented in the Bernese GNSS Software. The impact of the modelled non-gravitational forces has been evaluated with Swarm and GRACE LEOs with all the available validation and comparison methods: PCA, accelerometer data, GPS observation fit, satellite laser ranging observations and K/Ka-band ranging measurements. As expected, the implementation of all the forces reduces the standard deviation of the PCA in each direction, for both Swarm C (-8% in radial, -56% in along-track and -22% in cross-track) and GRACE A (-73% in radial, -75% in along-track and -20% in cross-track). Regarding the mean values for Swarm C a large reduction is observed in: along-track (-129%) and cross-track (-97%) direction, but the mean acceleration in radial direction increase by a few percent (7%). For GRACE A, the mean values of the PCA are reduced along each orbital axis (-88% in radial, -112% in along-track and -23% in cross-track). In addition to the PCA reduction, the precision of the reduced-dynamic orbit has also been improved by the modelling of the non-gravitational forces. In terms of values the a posteriori standard deviation of unit weight of 1.96 mm has been reduced to 1.93 mm for Swarm and from 2.3 mm to 1.45 mm for GRACE. Finally, different parameterizations of the aerodynamic forces have been carried out in order to determine the best atmospheric model and gas-surface interaction algorithm for LEO POD improvement. The impact of a horizontal wind model has been tested. More specifically: modelling the gas-surface interaction with Goodman's model using the DTM2013 atmospheric model with the horizontal wind correction HWM14 have shown the best results in LEO POD.},

abstract = {Empirical mass density models for the thermosphere are widely used for object orbit determination and prediction, object collision avoidance, and re-entry analysis. But the error of these empirical models can often reach 15∼30% or even larger during highly disturbed periods of the space environment. On the other hand, the mass density of the thermosphere can be derived from the orbit information contained in the two line elements (TLE) dataset. This technique provides an approach for calibrating the empirical model. Here we select TLE data of 36 low Earth orbiters (LEOs) recorded during 2000∼2002 (solar maximum). The ratios of the TLE-derived densities to those from the empirical NRLMSISE00 model are calculated and used to calibrate the scale error of the NRLMSISE00 model by applying a linear height-dependent function. The calibration models for the NRLMSISE00 model during 2000∼2002 are then obtained by a least squares adjustment procedure. The calibration factors at 250 km, 400 km, and 550 km from this calibration model are compared to the density ratios obtained by Emmert (2009) who used TLE data from ∼5000 LEOs. The result indicates that the biases between these two independent factors at the 3 altitudes are all within +/-2%, and the standard deviations (STDs) are under 7%. Another 5 LEOs with altitudes ranging from 200 km to 500 km are also selected to validate the precision of the calibration model. Their density ratios are calculated using the calibration model and the NRLMSISE00 model, respectively. The results demonstrate that by applying this calibration method the relative root mean square (RMS) error of the NRLMSISE00 model can be reduced by about 9%.},

abstract = {The number of tectonic plates on Earth described in the literature has expanded greatly since the start of the plate tectonic era, when only about a dozen plates were considered in global models of present-day plate motions. With new techniques of more accurate earthquake epicenter locations, modern ways of measuring ocean bathymetry using swath mapping, and the use of space based geodetic techniques, there has been a huge growth in the number of plates thought to exist. The study by Bird (2003) proposed 52 plates, many of which were delineated on the basis of earthquake locations. Because of the pattern of areas of these plates, he suggested that there should be more small plates than he could identify. In this paper, I gather together publications that have proposed a total of 107 new plates, giving 159 plates in all. The largest plate (Pacific) is about 20 % of the Earth's area or 104 Mm2, and the smallest of which (Plate number 5 from Hammond et al. 2011) is only 273 km2 in area. Sorting the plates by size allows us to investigate how size varies as a function of order. There are several changes of slope in the plots of plate number organized by size against plate size order which are discussed. The sizes of the largest seven plates is constrained by the area of the Earth. A middle set of 73 plates down to an area of 97,563 km2 (the Danakil plate at number 80, is the plate of median size) follows a fairly regular pattern of plate size as a function of plate number. For smaller plates, there is a break in the slope of the plate size/plate number plot and the next 32 plates follow a pattern of plate size proposed by the models of Koehn et al. (2008) down to an area of 11,638 km2 (West Mojave plate # 112). Smaller plates do not follow any regular pattern of area as a function of plate number, probably because we have not sampled enough of these very small plates to reveal any clear pattern.},

The innovations compared to the last release include the use of improved background models and the processing of GPS phase measurements. Furthermore, the daily snapshots are applied as de-aliasing product in the calculation of the monthly and static gravity field models. As will be shown in the presentation, this procedure appears to be a very important step towards reaching the GRACE baseline accuracy. The results are validated by comparision with independent data sets such as daily time series of GPS station height variations and in-situ ocean bottom pressure data. It will be shown that large parts of the variations in these sensors can be explained by the daily ITG-GRACE Kalman solutions.},

abstract = {Satellite missions CHAMP and GRACE dedicated to global mapping of the Earths gravity field yield accurate satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST) data used for recovery of global geopotential models usually in a form of a finite set of Stokess coefficients. The US-German Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) yields SST data in both the high-low and low-low mode. Observed satellite positions and changes in the intersatellite range can be inverted through the Newtonian equation of motion into values of the unknown geopotential. The geopotential is usually approximated in observation equations by a truncated harmonic series with unknown coefficients. An alternative approach based on integral inversion of the SST data of type GRACE into discrete values of the geopotential at a geocentric sphere is discussed in this article. In this approach, observation equations have a form of Greens surface integrals with scalar-valued integral kernels. Despite their higher complexity, the kernel functions exhibit features typical for other integral kernels used in geodesy for inversion of gravity field data. The two approaches are discussed and compared based on their relative advantages and intended applications. The combination of heterogeneous gravity data through integral equations is also outlined in the article.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide occurs naturally throughout Earth'satmosphere. In the thermosphere, CO2 is the primary radiative cooling agent and fundamentally affects the energy balance and temperature of this high-altitude atmospheric layer. Anthropogenic CO2 increases are expected to propagate upward throughout the entire atmosphere, which should result in a cooler, more contracted thermosphere. This contraction, in turn, will reduce atmospheric drag on satellites and may have adverse consequences for the orbital debris environment that is already unstable. However, observed thermospheric mass density trends derived from satellite orbits are generally stronger than model predictions, indicating that our quantitative understanding of these changes is incomplete. So far, CO2 trends have been measured only up to 35 km altitude. Here, we present direct evidence that CO2 concentrations in the upper atmosphere—probably the primary driver of long-term thermospheric trends—are increasing. We analyse eight years of CO2 and carbon monoxide mixing ratios derived from satellite-based solar occultation spectra. After correcting for seasonal–latitudinal and solar influences, we obtain an estimated global increase in COx (CO2 and CO, combined) concentrations of 23.5±6.3 ppm per decade at an altitude of 101 km, about 10 ppm per decade faster than predicted by an upper atmospheric model. We suggest that this discrepancy may explain why the thermospheric density decrease is stronger than expected.},

abstract = {We present a global water cycle reanalysis that reconciles water balance estimates derived from the GRACE satellite mission, satellite water level altimetry and off-line estimates from several hydrological models. Error estimates for the sequential data assimilation scheme were derived from available uncertainty information and the triple collocation technique. Errors in four GRACE storage products were estimated to be 11–12 mm over land areas, while errors in monthly storage changes derived from five global hydrological models were estimated to be 17–28 mm. Prior and posterior estimates were evaluated against independent observations of river water level and discharge, snow water storage and glacier mass loss. Data assimilation improved or maintained agreement overall, although results varied regionally. Uncertainties were greatest in regions where glacier mass loss and sub-surface storage decline are both plausible but poorly constrained. We calculated a global water budget for 2003–2012. The main changes were a net loss of polar ice (−341 Gt yr−1) and mountain glaciers (−185 Gt yr−1), with an additional decrease in seasonal snow pack (−19 Gt yr−1). Storage in lakes increased by +77 Gt yr−1, due to new reservoir impoundments (+87 Gt yr−1), water level change in the Caspian Sea (−27 Gt yr−1) and net increases in the remaining lakes combined (+17 Gt yr−1). There was no change in subsurface storage, because groundwater depletion (−90 Gt yr−1) was offset by increased water storage in the seasonally wet tropics of South America and southern Africa (+87 Gt yr−1), which agrees with observed and predicted changes in the tropical monsoon.},

Observations from the BeiDou Experimental Tracking Stations (BETS) and the IGS Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) network from 1 January to 31 March 2013 are processed for orbit determination of the BeiDou constellation. Various arc lengths and solar radiation pressure parameters are investigated. The reduced set of ECOM five-parameter model produces better performance than the full set of ECOM nine-parameter model for BeiDou IGSO and MEO. The orbit overlap for the middle days of 3-day arc solutions is better than 20 cm and 14 cm for IGSO and MEO in RMS, respectively. Satellite laser ranging residuals are better than 10 cm for both IGSO and MEO. For BeiDou GEO, the orbit overlap of several meters and satellite laser ranging residuals of several decimetres can be achieved.},

abstract = {Temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field are traditionally represented with a set of spherical harmonic coefficients derived once per month. In practice, however, the gravity field changes continuously (e.g. because of on-going hydrological processes). This discrepancy causes temporal aliasing which manifests itself as errors in the obtained gravity field models. The goal of this study is to quantify the influence of temporal aliasing caused by hydrological processes onto the quality of computed monthly gravity field models; the Zambezi river basin is used as the test area. The GRACE observations are simulated along the actual GRACE orbits as gravitational potential differences. The mass variations obtained by the Least Square adjustment are compared with the "true" values used for data simulations. It is shown that the optimal estimation period is determined by the trade-off between the two conflicting effects of ever-decreasing propagated noise and ever-increasing aliasing. Catchments smaller than roughly 2000km and estimation periods up to a month produce solutions with no noticeable aliasing. A catchment 3300km wide has an optimal estimation period of 15 days and the one that is 4400km large is most accurate if estimated for not more than I I days. This is under the assumption that aliasing does not corrupt the solution significantly if it is less than half the propagated noise.},

abstract = {Two 4.5-year sets of daily geocenter variations have been derived from GPS-LEO (Low-Earth Orbiter) tracking of the GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) satellites. The twin GRACE satellites, launched in March 2002, are each equipped with a BlackJack global positioning system (GPS) receiver for precise orbit determination and gravity recovery. Since launch, there have been significant improvements in the background force models used for satellite orbit determination, most notably the model for the geopotential, which has resulted in significant improvements to the orbit determination accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential for determining seasonal (annual and semiannual) geocenter variations using GPS-LEO tracking data from the GRACE twin satellites. Internal comparison between the GRACE-A and GRACE-B derived geocenter variations shows good agreement. In addition, the annual and semiannual variations of geocenter motions determined from this study have been compared with other space geodetic solutions and predictions from geophysical models. The comparisons show good agreement except for the phase of the z-translation component.},

abstract = {Accurate quantification of the millennial-scale mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its contribution to global sea-level rise remain challenging because of sparse in situ observations in key regions. Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is the ongoing response of the solid Earth to ice and ocean load changes occurring since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; $\sim$21 thousand years ago) and may be used to constrain the GrIS deglaciation history. We use data from the Greenland Global Positioning System network to directly measure GIA and estimate basin-wide mass changes since the LGM. Unpredicted, large GIA uplift rates of +12 mm/year are found in southeast Greenland. These rates are due to low upper mantle viscosity in the region, from when Greenland passed over the Iceland hot spot about 40 million years ago. This region of concentrated soft rheology has a profound influence on reconstructing the deglaciation history of Greenland. We reevaluate the evolution of the GrIS since LGM and obtain a loss of 1.5-m sea-level equivalent from the northwest and southeast. These same sectors are dominating modern mass loss. We suggest that the present destabilization of these marine-based sectors may increase sea level for centuries to come. Our new deglaciation history and GIA uplift estimates suggest that studies that use the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite mission to infer present-day changes in the GrIS may have erroneously corrected for GIA and underestimated the mass loss by about 20 gigatons/year.\nPresent destabilization of marine-based sectors in Greenland may increase sea level for centuries to come.\nPresent destabilization of marine-based sectors in Greenland may increase sea level for centuries to come.},

abstract = {Atom interferometry represents a quantum leap in the technology for the ultra-precise monitoring of accelerations and rotations and, therefore, for all the science that relies on the latter quantities. These sensors evolved from a new kind of optics based on matter-waves rather than light-waves and might result in an advancement of the fundamental detection limits by several orders of magnitude. Matter-wave optics is still a young, but rapidly progressing science. The Space Atom Interferometer project (SAI), funded by the European Space Agency, in a multi-pronged approach aims to investigate both experimentally and theoretically the various aspects of placing atom interferometers in space: the equipment needs, the realistically expected performance limits and potential scientific applications in a micro-gravity environment considering all aspects of quantum, relativistic and metrological sciences. A drop-tower compatible prototype of a single-axis atom interferometry accelerometer is under construction. At the same time the team is studying new schemes, e.g. based on degenerate quantum gases as source for the interferometer. A drop-tower compatible atom interferometry acceleration sensor prototype has been designed, and the manufacturing of its subsystems has been started. A compact modular laser system for cooling and trapping rubidium atoms has been assembled. A compact Raman laser module, featuring outstandingly low phase noise, has been realized. Possible schemes to implement coherent atomic sources in the atom interferometer have been experimentally demonstrated.},

abstract = {Measurements of the motion of natural (and artificial) bodies in the solar system provide key input on their interior structre and properties. Currently, the most accurate measurements of solar system dynamics are performed using radiometric tracking systems on planetary missions, providing range measurement with an accuracy in the order of 1 m. Laser ranging to Earth-orbiting satellites equipped with laser retroreflectors provides range data with (sub-)cm accuracy. Extending this technology to planetary missions, however, requires the use of an active space segment equipped with a laser detector and transmitter (for a two-way system). The feasibility of such measurements have been demonstrated at planetary distances, and used operationally (with a one-way system) for the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission. The topic of this dissertation is the analysis of the application of interplanetary laser ranging (ILR) to improve the science return from next-generation space missions, with a focus on planetary science objectives. We have simulated laser ranging data for a variety of mission and system architectures, analyzing the influence of both model and measurement uncertainties. Our simulations show that the single-shot measurement precision is relatively inconsequential compared to the systematic range errors, providing a strong rationale for the consistent use of single-photon signal-intensity operation. We find that great advances in planetary geodesy (tidal, rotational characteristics, etc.) could be achieved by ILR. However, the laser data should be accompanied by commensurate improvements in other measurements and data analysis models to maximize the system's science return. The science return from laser ranging data will be especially strong for planetary landers, with a radio system remaining the preferred choice for many orbiter missions. Furthermore, we conclude that the science case for a one-way laser ranging is relatively weak compared to next-generation radiometric tracking systems, requiring the development of much more accurate space-based clocks.},

We propose a stochastic differential equation based on the superposition of independent Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes driven by a $\Gamma$ ($\alpha$, $\beta$) process. Superposition of independent $\Gamma$ ($\alpha$, $\beta$) Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes offer analytic flexibility and provides a class of continuous time processes capable of exhibiting long memory behavior. The stochastic differential equation is applied to the study of earthquakes by fitting the superposed $\Gamma$ ($\alpha$, $\beta$) Ornstein–Uhlenbeck model to earthquake sequences in South America containing very large events (Mw ≥ 8). We obtained very good fit of the observed magnitudes of the earthquakes with the stochastic differential equations, which supports the use of this methodology for the study of earthquakes sequence.},

abstract = {[1] The amount of water stored and moving through the surface water bodies of large river basins (river, floodplains, wetlands) plays a major role in the global water and biochemical cycles and is a critical parameter for water resources management. However, the spatiotemporal variations of these freshwater reservoirs are still widely unknown at the global scale. Here, we propose a hypsographic curve approach to estimate surface freshwater storage variations over the Amazon basin combining surface water extent from a multi-satellite-technique with topographic data from the Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) from Advance Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Monthly surface water storage variations for 1993–2007 are presented, showing a strong seasonal and interannual variability, and are evaluated against in situ river discharge and precipitation. The basin-scale mean annual amplitude of $\sim$1200 km 3 is in the range of previous estimates and contributes to about half of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) total water storage variations. For the first time, we map the surface water volume anomaly during the extreme droughts of 1997 (October–November) and 2005 (September–October) and found that during these dry events the water stored in the river and floodplains of the Amazon basin was, respectively, $\sim$230 ($\sim$40%) and 210 ($\sim$50%) km 3 below the 1993–2007 average. This new 15 year data set of surface water volume represents an unprecedented source of information for future hydrological or climate modeling of the Amazon. It is also a first step toward the development of such database at the global scale.},

Self-attraction and loading effects driven by shrinking ice masses cause a spatially-varying redistribution of ocean waters that affects reconstructions of past sea level from sparse observations. We model the solid earth response to ice mass changes and find significant vertical deformation signals over large continental areas. We show how deformation rates have been strongly varying through the last century, which implies that they should be properly modelled before interpreting and extrapolating recent observations of vertical land motion and sea level change.},

abstract = {Signatures between monthly global Earth gravity field solutions obtained from GRACE satellite mission data are analyzed with respect to continental water storage variability. GRACE gravity field models are derived in terms of Stokes' coefficients of a spherical harmonic expansion of the gravitational potential from the analysis of gravitational orbit perturbations of the two GRACE satellites using GPS high-low and K-band low-low intersatellite tracking and on-board accelerometry. Comparing the GRACE observations, i.e., the mass variability extracted from temporal gravity variations, with the water mass redistribution predicted by hydrological models, it is found that, when filtering with an averaging radius of 750 km, the hydrological signals generated by the world's major river basins are clearly recovered by GRACE. The analyses are based on differences in gravity and continental water mass distribution over 3- and 6-month intervals during the period April 2002 to May 2003. A background model uncertainty of some 35 mm in equivalent water column height from one month to another is estimated to be inherent in the present GRACE solutions at the selected filter length. The differences over 3 and 6 months between the GRACE monthly solutions reveal a signal of some 75 mm scattering with peak values of 400 mm in equivalent water column height changes over the continents, which is far above the uncertainty level and about 50% larger than predicted by global hydrological models. The inversion method, combining GRACE results with the signal and stochastic properties of a hydrological model as `a priori' in a statistical least squares adjustment, significantly reduces the overall power in the obtained water mass estimates due to error reduction, but also reflects the current limitations in the hydrological models to represent total continental water storage change in particular for the major river basins.},

abstract = {Future gravity missions like GRACE Follow-on and beyond will deliver low-low satellite-to-satellite ranging measurements of a much increased precision on the order of nanometers. This necessitates a re-evaluation of the processes used in gravity field determination with an eye to numerical stability and computational precision. This study investigates the computation of dynamic orbits, which are used for multiple purposes in gravity recovery. They are, for example, used in computing linearized observations for the low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking instruments. The precision at which the dynamic orbits are determined thus must surpass the precision of the ranging observations. Dynamic orbits for GRACE were computed both in a simple simulation, where the force model was reduced to a static potential of degree and order 60, and for real observational data. Encke's method was employed while using a novel reference trajectory determined through rigorous optimization. This reference trajectory was parametrized with equinoctial elements to minimize errors resulting from imprecision in the reference motion. The differences in coordinates between successive iterations of orbit determination were used as a benchmark for the quality of the orbit solution. Using Encke's method with equinoctial elements, the coordinate difference between iterations was reduced from on the order of tens of micrometers to some nanometers in the spectral range relevant to GRACE satellite-to-satellite tracking observations. The resulting dynamic orbits are self-consistent to below the expected precision of the GRACE Follow-on ranging instruments.},

abstract = {The nature of the gravity field inverse problem amplifies the noise in the GRACE data, which creeps into the mid and high degree and order harmonic coefficients of the Earth's monthly gravity fields provided by GRACE. Due to the use of imperfect background models and data noise, these errors are manifested as north-south striping in the monthly global maps of equivalent water heights. In order to reduce these errors, this study investigates the use of the L-curve method with Tikhonov regularization. L-curve is a popular aid for determining a suitable value of the regularization parameter when solving linear discrete ill-posed problems using Tikhonov regularization. However, the computational effort required to determine the L-curve is prohibitively high for a large-scale problem like GRACE. This study implements a parameter-choice method, using Lanczos bidiagonalization which is a computationally inexpensive approximation to L-curve. Lanczos bidiagonalization is implemented with orthogonal transformation in a parallel computing environment and projects a large estimation problem on a problem of the size of about 2 orders of magnitude smaller for computing the regularization parameter. Errors in the GRACE solution time series have certain characteristics that vary depending on the ground track coverage of the solutions. These errors increase with increasing degree and order. In addition, certain resonant and near-resonant harmonic coefficients have higher errors as compared with the other coefficients. Using the knowledge of these characteristics, this study designs a regularization matrix that provides a constraint on the geopotential coefficients as a function of its degree and order. This regularization matrix is then used to compute the appropriate regularization parameter for each monthly solution. A 7-year time-series of the candidate regularized solutions (Mar 2003–Feb 2010) show markedly reduced error stripes compared with the unconstrained GRACE release 4 solutions (RL04) from the Center for Space Research (CSR). Post-fit residual analysis shows that the regularized solutions fit the data to within the noise level of GRACE. A time series of filtered hydrological model is used to confirm that signal attenuation for basins in the Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (TRIP) database over 320 km radii is less than 1 cm equivalent water height RMS, which is within the noise level of GRACE.},

abstract = {A technique for obtaining clock measurements from individual GNSS satellites at short time intervals is presented. The methodology developed in this study allows for accurate satellite clock stability analysis without an ultra-stable clock at the ground receiver. Variations in the carrier phase caused by the satellite clock are isolated using a combination of common GNSS carrier-phase processing techniques. Furthermore, the white phase variations caused by the thermal noise of the collection and processing equipment are statistically modeled and removed, allowing for analysis of clock performance at subsecond intervals. Allan deviation analyses of signals collected from GPS and GLONASS satellites reveal distinct intervals of clock noise for timescales less than 100 s. The clock data collected from GPS Block IIA, IIR, IIR-M, and GLONASS satellites reveal similar stability performance at time periods greater than 20 s. The GLONASS clock stability in the 0.6–10 s range, however, is significantly worse than GPS. Applications that rely on ultra-stable clock behavior from the GLONASS satellites at these timescales may therefore require high-rate corrections to estimate and remove oscillator-based errors in the carrier phase.},

abstract = {The new release of the sensor and instrument data (Level-1B release 02) of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) had a substantial impact on the improvement of the overall accuracy of the gravity field models. This has implied that improvements on the sensor data level can still significantly contribute to arriving closer to the GRACE baseline accuracy. The recent analysis of the GRACE star camera data (SCA1B RL02) revealed their unexpectedly higher noise. As the star camera (SCA) data are essential for the processing of the K-band ranging data and the accelerometer data, thorough investigation of the data set was needed. We fully reexamined the SCA data processing from Level-1A to Level-1B with focus on the combination method of the data delivered by the two SCA heads. In the first step, we produced and compared our own combined attitude solution by applying two different combination methods on the SCA Level-1A data. The first method introduces the information about the anisotropic accuracy of the star camera measurement in terms of a weighing matrix. This method was applied in the official processing as well. The alternative method merges only the well determined SCA boresight directions. This method was implemented on the GRACE SCA data for the first time. Both methods were expected to provide optimal solution characteristic by the full accuracy about all three axes, which was confirmed. In the second step, we analyzed the differences between the official SCA1B RL02 data generated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and our solution. SCA1B RL02 contains systematically higher noise of about a factor 3-4. The data analysis revealed that the reason is the incorrect implementation of algorithms in the JPL processing routines. After correct implementation of the combination method, significant improvement within the whole spectrum was achieved. Based on these results, the official reprocessing of the SCA data is suggested, as the SCA attitude data are one of the key observations needed for the gravity field recovery.},

abstract = {The satellite CHAMP carries the accelerometer STAR in its payload and thanks to the GPS and SLR tracking systems accurate orbit positions can be computed. Total atmospheric density values can be retrieved from the STAR measurements, with an absolute uncertainty of 10-15%, under the condition that an accurate radiative force model, satellite macro-model, and STAR instrumental calibration parameters are applied, and that the upper-atmosphere winds are less than 150 m/s. The STAR calibration parameters (i.e. a bias and a scale factor) of the tangential acceleration were accurately determined using an iterative method, which required the estimation of the gravity field coefficients in several iterations, the first result of which was the EIGEN-1S (Geophys. Res. Lett. 29 (14) (2002) 10.1029) gravity field solution. The procedure to derive atmospheric density values is as follows: (1) a reduced-dynamic CHAMP orbit is computed, the positions of which are used as pseudo-observations, for reference purposes; (2) a dynamic CHAMP orbit is fitted to the pseudo-observations using calibrated STAR measurements, which are saved in a data file containing all necessary information to derive density values; (3) the data file is used to compute density values at each orbit integration step, for which accurate terrestrial coordinates are available. This procedure was applied to 415 days of data over a total period of 21 months, yielding 1.2 million useful observations. The model predictions of DTM-2000 (EGS XXV General Assembly, Nice, France), DTM-94 (J. Geod. 72 (1998) 161) and MSIS-86 (J. Geophys. Res. 92 (1987) 4649) were evaluated by analysing the density ratios (i.e. "observed" to "computed" ratio) globally, and as functions of solar activity, geographical position and season. The global mean of the density ratios showed that the models underestimate density by 10-20%, with an rms of 16-20%. The binning as a function of local time revealed that the diurnal and semi-diurnal components are too strong in the DTM models, while all three models model the latitudinal gradient inaccurately. Using DTM-2000 as a priori, certain model coefficients were re-estimated using the STAR-derived densities, yielding the DTM-STAR test model. The mean and rms of the global density ratios of this preliminary model are 1.00 and 15%, respectively, while the tidal and latitudinal modelling errors become small. This test model is only representative of high solar activity conditions, while the seasonal effect is probably not estimated accurately due to correlation with the solar activity effect. At least one more year of data is required to separate the seasonal effect from the solar activity effect, and data taken under low solar activity conditions must also be assimilated to construct a model representative under all circumstances. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Since its launch in March 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has been measuring the global time variations of the Earth's gravity field with a current resolution of ∼500 km. Especially over the continents, these measurements represent the integrated land water mass, including surface waters (lakes, wetlands and rivers), soil moisture, groundwater, and snow cover. In this study, we use the GRACE land water solutions computed by Ramillien et al. (2005a) through an iterative inversion of monthly geoids from April 2002 to May 2004 to estimate time series of basin-scale regional evapotranspiration rate and associated uncertainties. Evapotranspiration is determined by integrating and solving the water mass balance equation, which relates land water storage (from GRACE), precipitation data (from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre), runoff (from a global land surface model), and evapotranspiration (the unknown). We further examine the sensibility of the computation when using different model runoff. Evapotranspiration results are compared to outputs of four different global land surface models. The overall satisfactory agreement between GRACE-derived and model-based evapotranspiration prove the ability of GRACE to provide realistic estimates of this parameter.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide insights into limitations imposed by current satellite-based strategies to delineate tidal variability in the thermosphere, as well as the ability of a state-of-the-art model to replicate thermospheric tidal determinations. Toward this end, we conducted a year-long thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) simulation for 2009, which is characterized by low solar and geomagnetic activity. In order to account for tropospheric waves and tides propagating upward into the ∼30–400 km model domain, we used 3-hourly MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application) reanalysis data. We focus on exospheric tidal temperatures, which are also compared with 72 day mean determinations from combined Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations to assess the model's capability to capture the observed tidal signatures and to quantify the uncertainties associated with the satellite exospheric temperature determination technique. We found strong day-to-day tidal variability in TIME-GCM that is smoothed out when averaged over as few as ten days. TIME-GCM notably overestimates the 72 day mean eastward propagating tides observed by CHAMP/GRACE, while capturing many of the salient features of other tidal components. However, the CHAMP/GRACE tidal determination technique only provides a gross climatological representation, underestimates the majority of the tidal components in the climatological spectrum, and moreover fails to characterize the extreme variability that drives the dynamics and electrodynamics of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. A multisatellite mission that samples at least six local times simultaneously is needed to provide this quantification.},

GRACE measurements are applied by calculating the magnitude of the deviation of regional, monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies from the time series' monthly climatology, where negative deviations represent storage deficits. Monthly deficits explicitly quantify the volume of water required to return to normal water storage conditions. We combine storage deficits with event duration to calculate drought severity. Drought databases are referenced to identify meteorological drought events in the Amazon and Zambezi River basins and the southeastern United States and Texas regions. This storage deficit method clearly identifies hydrological drought onset, end, and duration; quantifies instantaneous severity and peak drought magnitude; and compares well with the meteorological drought databases. It also reveals information about the hydrological effects of meteorological drought on regional water storage. {\textcopyright} 2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

We use these data to derive the time-varying gravity field of the Earth at 1500km resolution, on a monthly basis since December 2013. We combine the gravity field solutions computed with the data of all three satellites, as provided by the Astronomical Institute (ASU), Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB) and Institute of Geodesy (IfG) and demonstrate that this uninterrupted time series of gravity field models are in good agreement with the temporal variations observed by the GRACE satellites. The hl-SST data gathered by the Swarm satellites can be used to study large-scale mass changes globally, e.g. i) in the context of low-latency applications, such as the European Gravity Service for Improved Emergency Management project (http://egsiem.eu), ii) in those months where GRACE solutions are not available, and iii) as an important source of independent information for mitigating the GRACE/GRACE Follow-On gap.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has demonstrated that low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking enables monitoring the time variations of the Earth's gravity field on a global scale, in particular those caused by mass-transport within the hydrosphere. Due to the importance of long-term continued monitoring of the variations of the Earth's gravitational field and the limited lifetime of GRACE, a follow-on mission is currently planned to be launched in 2017. In order to minimise risk and the time to launch, the follow-on mission will be basically a rebuild of GRACE with microwave ranging as the primary instrument for measuring changes of the intersatellite distance. Laser interferometry has been proposed as a method to achieve improved ranging precision for future GRACE-like missions and is therefore foreseen to be included as demonstrator experiment in the follow-on mission now under development. This paper presents the top-level architecture of an interferometric laser ranging system designed to demonstrate the technology which can also operate in parallel with the microwave ranging system of the GRACE follow-on mission.},

abstract = {Abstract Remotely sensed imagery is being increasingly used for the development of the earth observation satellites to investigate human activities, to monitor environmental changes and to update existing geospatial data. The ordinary pictures are difficult to process automatically by computers but can be easily interpreted by humans. The most significant step is how to get anticipated information from the images and how to convert these images into useful data for further studies. The key objective is to satisfy an algorithm claiming to be efficient in large size image processing includ enhanced processing efficiency, finding correlation among data, and extracting continuous features. To achieve these objectives in the setting mentioned above, we propose a real-time approach for continuous feature extraction and detection in remote sensory earth observatory satellite images to find rivers, roads, and main highways. Deep analysis is made on the ENVISAT satellite missions datasets and based on this analysis the algorithm is proposed using statistical measurements, RepTree machine learning classifier, and Euclidean distance. The system is developed using Hadoop ecosystem to improve the efficiency of the system. The designed system consists of various steps including collection, filtration, load balancing, processing, merging, and interpretation. The system is implemented on Apache Hadoop system using MapReduce programming with higher efficiency results in a massive volume of satellite ASAR/ ENVISAT mission datasets.},

abstract = {Tide gauges measure sea level changes relative to land. To separate absolute changes in sea level from vertical land movements tide gauges are often co-located with Continuous GPS (CGPS). In order to achieve an accuracy of better than 1 mm/yr, as required for sea level studies in the global change context, vertical land motion needs to be determined with the same accuracy. This is an ambitious goal for CGPS and needs a carefully designed analysis strategy. We have compared the independent results from six different analysis centres, using three different GPS processing softwares and a number of different analysis strategies. Based on the comparison, we discuss the achieved accuracy and the quality of the different strategies. The data analysed are from the CGPS network of the European Sea Level Service and cover the time window from the beginning of 2000 until the end of 2003. The comparison reveals large differences in the day-to-day variations of the coordinate time series and also in the seasonal cycle contained in these. The trends show systematic differences, depending on software and strategy used. To a large extent, the latter deviations can be explained by differences in the realisation of the reference frame, while some parts may be due to other, as yet, unidentified contributions. The results suggest that the reference frame and its relation to the center of mass of the Earth system may be the main limitation in achieving the accuracy goal for the secular velocity of vertical land motion. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Potential differences between the twin GRACE vehicles are determined along short satellite tracks using the energy integral method (i.e., integration of orbit parameters vs. time) in a quasi-inertial terrestrial reference frame. Potential differences residuals corresponding mainly to changes in continental hydrology are then obtained after removing the gravitational effects of the known geophysical phenomena that are mainly the static part of the Earths gravity field and time-varying contributions to gravity (Sun, Moon, planets, atmosphere, ocean, tides, variations of Earths rotation axis) through ad hoc models. Regional surface mass anomalies are restored from potential difference anomalies of 10 to 30-day orbits onto 1 continental grids by regularization techniques based on singular value decomposition. Error budget analysis has been made by considering the important effects of spectrum truncation, the time length of observation (or spatial coverage of the data to invert) and for different levels of noise.},

abstract = {The concept of reliability was introduced into geodesy by Baarda (A testing procedure for use in geodetic networks. Publications on Geodesy, vol. 2. Netherlands Geodetic Commission, Delft, 1968). It gives a measure for the ability of a parameter estimation to detect outliers and leads in case of one outlier to the MDB, the minimal detectable bias or outlier. The MDB depends on the non-centrality parameter of the \(\chi ^2\) -distribution, as the variance factor of the linear model is assumed to be known, on the size of the outlier test of an individual observation which is set to 0.001 and on the power of the test which is generally chosen to be 0.80. Starting from an estimated variance factor, the \(F\) -distribution is applied here. Furthermore, the size of the test of the individual observation is a function of the number of outliers to keep the size of the test of all observations constant, say 0.05. The power of the test is set to 0.80. The MDBs for multiple outliers are derived here under these assumptions. The method is applied to the reconstruction of a bell-shaped surface measured by a laser scanner. The MDBs are introduced as outliers for the alternative hypotheses of the outlier tests. A Monte Carlo method reveals that due to the way of introducing the outliers, the false null hypotheses cannot be rejected on the average with a power of 0.80 if the MDBs are not enlarged by a factor.},

abstract = {High frequency temporal gravity changes on sub-monthly time scales are caused by Earths mass transport primarily originating from tidal and nontidal atmospheric and oceanic motions. Exploitation of precise GRACE satellite-to-satellite ranging measurements now makes it possible to monitor these changes on a global scale with a moderate spatial resolution. Thus, a time series of daily 10 10 Earth gravity models has been produced for the time span from July 2 to September 30, 2003. The solid Earth, oceanic and atmospheric tidal forces are accounted for during data processing, while variations in the gravitational potential produced by non-tidal atmosphere and ocean mass transport are omitted in the apriori force models. The recovered gravity changes are then compared to non-tidal model predictions. It is found that the agreement varies with the degree and order of the gravity harmonics. Generally, the recovered harmonics are highly correlated with the models for low order coefficients but the agreement degrades when the order becomes larger. Our results prove that GRACE is able to trace geophysical signals at short time scales, and that GRACE data can be useful to validate model predicted large-scale mass transports. Once we are able to separate tidal and nontidal signals for a longer time span, daily gravity recovery might also prove to be useful to study gravity changes taking place at sub-monthly time scales, such as oceanic tides.},

abstract = {We report small but detectable changes in the GRACE satellites' relative trajectory after the M8.8 Maule, Chile earthquake on 27 February 2010 that can be used to delineate the shift in the gravity field. A gravity anomaly of −5 $\mu$Gal with a spatial scale of 500 km was found east of the epicenter after the earthquake. Based on coseismic models, the long-wavelength negative gravity change is primarily the result of crustal dilatation as well as surface subsidence in the onland region. The offshore positive gravity anomaly predicted from finite fault coseismic models is considerably smaller because the gravity changes due to surface uplift and interior deformation are opposite in polarity. Our study suggests a role for large-scale gravity observations in deciphering changes of the Earth's interior during great earthquakes by filling in the seldom-observed long-wavelength spectrum of earthquake deformations as a complement to surface geodetic measurements and seismic data.},

abstract = {The spatiotemporal resolution of the time-variable gravity field models derived from current dedicated gravity field missions is inherently limited by their ground-track coverage. Furthermore, the results are subject to aliasing effects caused by submonthly mass transport signals, such as those caused by atmospheric and ocean processes. To address these issues, this study explores the feasibility of using nondedicated satellite constellations, such as those from commercial communication networks or a low-cost array of custom-built microsatellites, as a complementary data source. The positioning receivers onboard the constellation's satellites would ideally provide a high density of observations in the form of derived accelerations that, while much less accurate than those obtained from dedicated gravity missions, are still sufficient to observe the longest wavelength gravity signals at even subdaily intervals. Using a series of simulated mission scenarios, as well as a limited amount of real-data analysis, it is shown that such constellations, acting either independently or when combined with dedicated gravity field missions, may offer a noticeable improvement in the recovery of the large-scale (greater than 1000 km) high-frequency (less than 1 month) components of the global gravity field.},

abstract = {In order to perform probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (PTHA) based on subduction zone earthquakes, it is necessary to start with a catalog of possible future events along with the annual probability of occurance, or a probability distribution of such events that can be easily sampled. For nearfield events, the distribution of slip on the fault can have a significant effect on the resulting tsunami. We present an approach to defining a probability distribution based on subdividing the fault geometry into many subfaults and prescribing a desired covariance matrix relating slip on one subfault to slip on any other subfault. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix are then used to define a Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion for random slip patterns. This is similar to a spectral representation of random slip based on Fourier series but conforms to a general fault geometry. We show that only a few terms in this series are needed to represent the features of the slip distribution that are most important in tsunami generation, first with a simple one-dimensional example where slip varies only in the down-dip direction and then on a portion of the Cascadia Subduction Zone.},

abstract = {Traditional carrier phase combinations are linear functions of the original carrier phases. We develop a new way of carrier phase combination that regards carrier phases of different frequencies as the basis of the carrier phase space. The combined carrier phase is a point of this space. Then, this point, i.e., the combined carrier phase, is mapped back to a single-dimensional carrier phase by a bidirectional mapping. The new single-dimensional carrier phase is called mapped carrier phase. The advantages of this combination approach are a long wavelength and small noise of the mapped carrier phase, which make ambiguity resolution easy. Unfortunately, the mapped carrier phase value is not well determined due to the noise in the observed phases. On the contrary, a set of possible mapped carrier phase values are attained; however, only one value is correct. To reduce the number of candidates and fix the correct value of the mapped carrier phase, the following steps are discussed: (1) The integer nature of the original carrier ambiguity is used to attain an initial set of possible mapped carrier phase values; (2) the distribution of the mapped carrier phase ambiguity is included to reduce the possible values; and (3) the Gaussian least-squares objective function is introduced to fix the correct value. As a result of these steps, a single-epoch positioning algorithm is established. Two experiments are carried out to preliminarily compare the new algorithm with LAMBDA. The results show that the new algorithm is slightly below LAMBDA in resolution success rate, but computationally more efficient than LAMBDA.},

All formations have comparable orbit characteristics: near polar, near eccentric, and short baselines of typically 10 km length. First, we demonstrate that these orbits are sufficiently stable at low altitudes in a realistic gravity field. Next, we perform a closed-loop simulation, in which an input gravity field is used for orbit integration and generation of observations in the forward mode. Subsequently, in the inverse mode, the gravity field is recovered. Comparison between input and output fields demonstrate that gravity recovery based on sst observables from formations containing radial and/or out-of-plane information outperform grace-type along-track sst. The gravity fields recovered from the former formation types possess a lower error spectrum and an isotropic error structure.},

In addition, these receivers serve as instruments for geodetic, atmospheric research and many other space missions. The ability to replace some hardware components in a GNSS receiver with software-based signal processing techniques has already produced benefits for prototyping new equipment based on Software Defined Radio(SDR). This paper presents a new low cost GNSS software receivers for microsatellites. Shrinking space programs and the interest in faster mission implementations have raised the attractiveness of small and micro-satellites which benefit most from reduction in the cost, size, mass and power consumption of avionics equipment. This paper presents a high performance GNSS software receiver equipment specially designed and optimized for the needs and constraints of small platforms for which small volume, low mass and low power consumption are important parameters. This equipment is based on COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) in order to exploit the performance of the advanced technology developed for terrestrial applications and to reduce significantly the global cost of the equipment. This proposed GNSS software receiver dedicated to low earth orbit (LEO) satellites will withstand the radiation environment therefore the hardware and software architecture has been defined to reduce the single event effects (SEE) and to maximize the service availability. &copy; 2013 IEEE.},

We evaluate Greenland GIA corrections from Simpson et al (2009 Quat. Sci. Rev. 28 1631–57), A et al (2013 Geophys. J. Int. 192 557–72) and Wu et al (2010 Nature Geosci. 3 642–6) by comparing the spatial patterns of GRACE-derived ice mass trends calculated using the three corrections with volume changes from ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) and OIB (Operation IceBridge) altimetry missions, and surface mass balance products from the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO). During the period September 2003–August 2011, GRACE ice mass changes obtained using the Simpson et al (2009 Quat. Sci. Rev. 28 1631–57) and A et al (2013 Geophys. J. Int. 192 557–72) GIA corrections yield similar spatial patterns and amplitudes, and are consistent with altimetry observations and surface mass balance data. The two GRACE estimates agree within 2% on average over the entire ice sheet, and better than 15% in four subdivisions of Greenland. The third GRACE estimate corrected using the (Wu et al 2010 Nature Geosci. 3 642–6)) GIA shows similar spatial patterns, but produces an average ice mass loss for the entire ice sheet that is 64 67 Gt yr 1 smaller. In the Northeast the recovered ice mass change is 46–49 Gt yr 1 (245–270%) more positive than that deduced from the other two corrections. By comparing the spatial and temporal variability of the GRACE estimates with trends of volume changes from altimetry and surface mass balance from RACMO, we show that the Wu et al (2010 Nature Geosci. 3 642–6) correction leads to a large mass increase in the Northeast that is inconsistent with independent observations.},

abstract = {Geodetic adjustment models are often set up in a way that the model parameters need to fulfil certain constraints. The normalized Lagrange multipliers have been used as a measure of the strength of constraint in such a way that if one of them exceeds in magnitude a certain threshold then the corresponding constraint is likely to be incompatible with the observations and the rest of the constraints. We show that these and similar measures can be deduced as test statistics of a likelihood ratio test of the statistical hypothesis that some constraints are incompatible in the same sense. This has been done before only for special constraints (Teunissen in Optimization and Design of Geodetic Networks, pp. 526-547, 1985). We start from the simplest case, that the full set of constraints is to be tested, and arrive at the advanced case, that each constraint is to be tested individually. Every test is worked out both for a known as well as for an unknown prior variance factor. The corresponding distributions under null and alternative hypotheses are derived. The theory is illustrated by the example of a double levelled line. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {As planetary boundaries are rapidly being approached, humanity has little room for additional\nexpansion and conventional intensification of agriculture, while a growing world population further\nspreads the food gap. Ample evidence exists that improved on-farm water management can close\nwater-related yield gaps to a considerable degree, but its global significance remains unclear. In\nthis modeling study we investigate systematically to what extent integrated crop water management\nmight contribute to closing the global food gap, constrained by the assumption that pressure on\nwater resources and land does not increase. Using a process-based bio-/agrosphere model, we simulate\nthe yield-increasing potential of elevated irrigation water productivity (including irrigation\nexpansion with thus saved water) and optimized use of in situ precipitation water (alleviated soil\nevaporation, enhanced infiltration, water harvesting for supplemental irrigation) under current and\nprojected future climate (from 20 climate models, with and without beneficial CO 2 effects). Results\nshow that irrigation efficiency improvements can save substantial amounts of water in many river\nbasins (globally 48% of non-productive water consumption in an ‘ambitious' scenario), and if\nrerouted to irrigate neighboring rainfed systems, can boost kcal production significantly (26%\nglobal increase). Low-tech solutions for small-scale farmers on water-limited croplands show the\npotential to increase rainfed yields to a similar extent. In combination, the ambitious yet\nachievable integrated water management strategies explored in this study could increase global\nproduction by 41% and close the water-related yield gap by 62%. Unabated climate change will have\nadverse effects on crop yields in many regions, but improvements in water management as analyzed\nhere can buffer such effects to a significant degree.},

@article{VanderWal2011,
abstract = {In areas dominated by Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), the free-air gravity anomaly rate can be converted to uplift rate to good approximation by using a simple spectral relation. We provide quantitative comparisons between gravity rates derived from monthly gravity field solutions (GFZ Potsdam, CSR Texas, IGG Bonn) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission with uplift rates measured by GPS in these areas. The band-limited gravity data from the GRACE satellite mission can be brought to very good agreement with the point data from GPS by using scaling factors derived from a GIA model (the root-mean-square of differences is 0.55 mm yr–1 for a maximum uplift rate signal of 10 mm yr–1). The root-mean-square of the differences between GRACE derived uplift rates and GPS derived uplift rates decreases with increasing GRACE time period to a level below the uncertainty that is expected from GRACE observations, GPS measurements and the conversion from gravity rate to uplift rate. With the current length of time-series (more than 8 yr) applying filters and a hydrology correction to the GRACE data does not reduce the root-mean-square of differences significantly. The smallest root-mean-square was obtained with the GFZ solution in Fennoscandia and with the CSR solution in North America. With radial gravity rates in excellent agreement with GPS uplift rates, more information on the GIA process can be extracted from GRACE gravity field solutions in the form of tangential gravity rates, which are equivalent to a rate of change in the deflection of the vertical scaled by the magnitude of gravity rate vector. Tangential gravity rates derived from GRACE point towards the centre of the previously glaciated area, and are largest in a location close to the centre of the former ice sheet. Forward modelling showed that present day tangential gravity rates have maximum sensitivity between the centre and edge of the former ice sheet, while radial gravity rates are most sensitive in the centre of the former ice sheet. As a result, tangential gravity rates offer constraints on a two-layer mantle viscosity profile that are different from radial gravity rates, which can be exploited in future GIA studies.},

abstract = {An atlas of the main components of the tides has been produced on the basis of a finite element hydrodynamic model, with the aim of offering the scientific community, using satellite altimetric data, a prediction of the tidal contribution to sea surface height variations under the ground tracks of the satellites that is totally independent of altimetric measurements. The geographic coverage of the simulations only excludes, temporarily, some marginal seas like the Bay of Fundy. But the design of the model, based on a nonlinear formulation of the shallow water equations, could enable the simulations to be extended to these very singular areas. On the other hand, the Arctic Basin and the Antarctic Circumpolar Basin have been fully resolved, including the under-ice shelf areas of the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea. Eight constituents, M 2, S 2, N 2, K 2, {2N} 2, K 1, O 1, and Q 1 have been simulated. Five secondary constituents: Mu 2, Nu 2, L 2, T 2, and P 1, required to insure a priori correct predictions, have been deduced by admittance. The accuracy and precision of these solutions have been estimated by reference to the harmonic constituents data set available from analysis of the entire collection of pelagic, plateau and coastal observations made to date, and archived by International Association for Physical Sciences of the Oceans and International Hydrographie Bureau. Over the deep oceans, these solutions fit the observations to within a few centimeters for the larger components: M 2, S 2, K 1, O 1, and a few millimeters for the others, in {RMS} maximum difference to a standard set of 78 ground truth stations. Over the shelves, the differences are larger, because of the increase in amplitude of the tidal waves, but the flexibility offered by the finite element technique to refine the discretization mesh of the model over the shallow seas enables detailed cotidal maps to be produced along the coasts. One zoom on South Georgia Island, in the South Atlantic Ocean, is presented as an illustration. Finally, the performances of the tidal predictions made on the basis of this new set of solutions was tested by looking at the residual {RMS} differences at the crossover points of sea level measurements supplied by the {TOPEX/POSEIDON} mission, when using these predictions. This test provided confirmation of most of the conclusions already drawn on the basis of the previous comparisons with in situ tide gauge data.},

abstract = {A GPS-based method is presented to measure vegetation water content. Commercially available geodetic-quality GPS receivers and antennas are used. The method is tested using GPS measurements collected over three field seasons. The GPS data are compared with in situ data for three plant types: desert grass, wheat, and alfalfa. The GPS retrievals of vegetation water content are based on the GPS signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data. Instrumental issues that affect the SNR data are discussed, particularly satellite transmit power variations, footprint variations, and temperature effects. The amplitudes of the SNR data show a nearly linear relationship to the water content in grasses (0–0.5 kg/m2) and wheat crops (0–0.9 kg/m2). As predicted by theory, this simple linear relationship breaks down in vegetation with heavy water content, such as alfalfa. The field results are consistent with forward model predictions, whose effect restricts the use of this simple linear model for vegetation to water content of less than $\sim$1 kg/m2.},

abstract = {Satellite gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provides quantitative measures of terrestrial water storage (TWS) change at large spatial scales. Combining GRACE-observed TWS changes and model estimates of water storage changes in soil and snow at the surface offers a means for measuring groundwater storage change. In this study, we re-assess long-term groundwater storage variation in the Northwest India (NWI) region using an extended record of GRACE time-variable gravity measurements, and a fully unconstrained global forward modeling method. Our new assessments based on the GRACE release-5 (RL05) gravity solutions indicate that during the 10. year period January 2003 to December 2012, the NWI groundwater depletion remains pronounced, especially during the first 5. years (01/2003-12/2007). The newly estimated depletion rates are $\sim$. 20.4. ±. 7.1 Gigatonne (Gt)/yr averaged over the 10. year period, and 29.4. ±. 8.4 Gt/yr during the first 5. years. The yearly groundwater storage changes in the NWI region are strongly correlated with yearly precipitation anomalies. In 2009, the driest season of the decade, the groundwater depletion reaches nearly 80 Gt, while in the two relatively wet seasons, 2008 and 2011, the groundwater storages even see net increases of about 24 and 35 Gt, respectively. The estimated mean groundwater depletion rates for the first 5. years are significantly higher than previous assessments. The larger depletion rates may reflect the benefits from improved data quality of GRACE RL05 gravity solutions, and improved data processing method, which can more effectively reduce leakage error in GRACE estimates. Our analysis indicates that the neighboring Punjab Province of Pakistan (especially Northern Punjab) apparently also experiences significant groundwater depletion during the same period, which has partly contributed to the new regional groundwater depletion estimates. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

GRAIL adapts the mission design and instrumentation from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to a make a precise gravitational map of Earth's Moon. Phase measurements of Ka-band carrier signals transmitted between spacecraft with line-of-sight separations between 50 km to 225 km provide the primary observable. Measurements of time offsets between the orbiters, frequency calibrations, and precise orbit determination provided by the Global Positioning System on GRACE are replaced by an S-band time-transfer cross link and Deep Space Network Doppler tracking of an X-band radioscience beacon and the spacecraft telecommunications link. Lack of an atmosphere at the Moon allows use of a single-frequency link and elimination of the accelerometer compared to the GRACE instrumentation.

abstract = {A comprehensive analysis of satellite datasets has estimated that the ice sheets of Greenland, West Antarctica, the Antarctic Peninsula, and East Antarctica experienced a net mass loss of -100 ± 92Gtyr"' over the period 1992-2000 and -298 ± 58Gtyr"' over the period 2000-11, representing an increase of -198 ± 109 Gt yr$\sim$ ' between the two epochs. The authors demonstrate that the time rate of change of the degree- four zonal harmonic of Earth's gravitational potential j ^ provides an independent check on these mass balances that is less sensitive to uncertainties that have contaminated previous analyses of the degree-2 zonal harmonic [e.g., due to ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), solid Earth body tides, and core-mantle coupling]. For the period 2000-11, the J^ signal implied by the ice sheet mass fiux cited above is (3.8 ± 0.6) X 10$\sim$"yr"', whereas the change in the j ^ harmonic across the two epochs is (2.3 ± 1.1) x 10$\sim$"yr"'. In comparison, using satellite laser ranging (SLR) data, the authors estimate a GIA-corrected J^ value of (3.8 ± 0.6) X 10$\sim$"yr"' for the epoch 2000-11 and a change across the two epochs of (5.3 ± 1.6) X 10$\sim$"yr"'.The authors conclude that the former supports recent estimates of melting over the last decade, whereas the latter suggests either that estimated melt rates for the earlier epoch were too high or that the uncertainty associated with the SLR-based inference otJn during the earlier epoch is underestimated.},

abstract = {Within the last decade, GNSS Precise Point Positioning (PPP) has generated unprecedented interest among the GNSS community and is being used for a number of scientific and commercial applications today. Similar to the conventional relative positioning technique, PPP could provide positioning solutions at centimeter-level precision by making use of the precise carrier phase measurements and high-accuracy satellite orbits and clock corrections provided by, for example, the International GNSS Service. The PPP technique is attractive as it is computationally efficient; it eliminates the need for simultaneous observations at both the reference and rover receivers; it also eliminates the needs for the rover receiver to operate within the vicinity of the reference receiver; and it provides homogenous positioning quality within a consistent global frame anywhere in the world with a single GNSS receiver. Although PPP has definite advantages for many applications, its merits and widespread adoption are significantly limited by the long convergence time, which restricts the use of the PPP technique for many real-time GNSS applications. We provide an overview of the current performance of PPP as well as attempt to address some of the common misconceptions of this positioning technique—considered by many as the future of satellite positioning and navigation. Given the upcoming modernization and deployment of GNSS satellites over the next few years, it would be appropriate to address the potential impacts of these signals and constellations on the future prospect of PPP.},

abstract = {The geoid can be used to validate the satellite gravity gradiometry data. Validation of such data is important prior to their downward continuation because of amplification of the data errors through this process. In this paper, the second-order radial derivative of Abel-Poisson's formula is modified stochastically to reduce the effect of the far-zone geoid and generate the second-order radial derivative of geopotential at 250 km level. The numerical studies over Fennoscandia show that this method yields the gradients with an error of 10 mE and when the long wavelength of geoid is removed from the estimator and restored after the computations (remove-compute-restore) the error will be in 1 mE level. We name this method semi-stochastic modification. The best case scenario is found when the degree of modification of the integral formula is 200 and the long wavelength geoid to degree 100 is removed and restored. In this case the geoid should have a resolution of 15??? ?? 15??? and the integration should be performed over a cap size of 3??. ?? 2010 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Since the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellites in March 2002, data quality has been improved significantly. For the star camera and accelerometer data, the calibration parameters have been well determined and used in data generating and processing. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how well the GRACE satellite orbits can be determined using improved accelerometer data and to assess the differences between the use of accelerometer data and the use of a priori models for the surface forces. As is known, the orbit accuracy depends on the force models used in the dynamic orbit determination, but the models for the surface forces acting on low-Earth satellites are uncertain. To alleviate this problem, the GRACE concept uses a three-axis accelerometer to measure the non-gravitational accelerations. To reduce the effects of force model error on precise orbit determination, one can estimate a set of empirical parameters. In the case of highly variable forces acting on satellites (such as high solar activity), the accelerometer provides high quality measurements of the phenomena. For this investigation, we have analyzed the data during high solar activity. The orbit accuracy is assessed using a number of tests, which include analysis of orbit fits, Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) residuals, K-Band Ranging (KBR) residuals and external orbit comparison. The results show that an accuracy of about 2cm in each component is achieved for the GRACE orbits and better orbits can be determined using accelerometer data during high solar activity. In addition, the GRACE orbits generated with the accelerometer data are generally better in the high frequency range.},

@article{Elsaka2013,
abstract = {The goal of this contribution is to focus on improving the quality of gravity field models in the form of spherical harmonic representation via alternative configuration scenarios applied in future gravimetric satellite missions. We performed full-scale simulations of various mission scenarios within the frame work of the German joint research project "Concepts for future gravity field satellite missions" as part of the Geotechnologies Program, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation. In contrast to most previous simulation studies including our own previous work, we extended the simulated time span from one to three consecutive months to improve the robustness of the assessed performance. New is that we performed simulations for seven dedicated satellite configurations in addition to the GRACE scenario, serving as a reference baseline. These scenarios include a "GRACE Follow-on" mission (with some modifications to the currently implemented GRACE-FO mission), and an in-line "Bender" mission, in addition to five mission scenarios that include additional cross-track and radial information. Our results clearly confirm the benefit of radial and cross-track measurement information compared to the GRACE along-track observable: the gravity fields recovered from the related alternative mission scenarios are superior in terms of error level and error isotropy. In fact, one of our main findings is that although the noise levels achievable with the particular configurations do vary between the simulated months, their order of performance remains the same. Our findings show also that the advanced pendulums provide the best performance of the investigated single formations, however an accuracy reduced by about 2-4 times in the important long-wavelength part of the spectrum (for spherical harmonic degrees <50, compared to the Bender mission, can be observed. Concerning state-of-the-art mission constraints, in particular the severe restriction of heterodyne lasers on maximum range-rates, only the moderate Pendulum and the Bender-mission are beneficial options, of course in addition to GRACE and GRACE-FO. Furthermore, a Bender-type constellation would result in the most accurate gravity field solution by a factor of about 12 at long wavelengths (up to degree/order 40) and by a factor of about 200 at short wavelengths (up to degree/order 120) compared to the present GRACE solution.

abstract = {A large earthquake of 7.8 magnitude occurred on 25 April 2015, 06:26 UTC, with the epicenter in Nepal. Here, taking advantage of measurements provided by the Swarm magnetic satellites, we investigate the possibility to detect some series of pre-earthquake magnetic anomalous signals, likely due to a lithosphere–atmosphere–ionosphere coupling, that can be a potential earthquake precursory pattern. Different techniques have been applied to Swarm data available during two months around earthquake occurrence. From the detected magnetic anomalies series (during night and magnetically quiet times or with an automatic detection algorithm), we show that the cumulative number of anomalies follows the same typical power-law behavior of a critical system approaching its critical time, and hence recovers as the typical recovery phase after a large event. The similarity of this behavior with the one obtained from seismic data analysis and the application of the analyses also to another period without significant seismicity do support a lithospheric-linked origin of the observed magnetic anomalies. We suggest that they might be connected to the preparation phase of the Nepal earthquake.},

abstract = {SUMMARY High-frequency, time-varying mass redistributions in the ocean and atmosphere have an impact on GRACE gravity field solutions due to the space–time sampling characteristics of signal and orbit. Consequently, aliasing of these signals into the GRACE observations is present and needs to be taken into account during data analysis by applying atmospheric and oceanic model data (de-aliasing). As the accuracy predicted prior to launch could not yet be achieved in the analysis of real GRACE data, the de-aliasing process and related geophysical model uncertainties are regarded as a potential error source in GRACE gravity field determination. Therefore, this study aims to improve the de-aliasing process in order to obtain a more accurate GRACE gravity field time-series. As these time-series provide estimates for the integrated mass transport in the Earth system, like the global water cycle and solid Earth geophysical processes, any increase in accuracy will lead to improvements in the geophysical interpretation of the results. So in conclusion, improving the de-aliasing is of relevance for a better understanding of geophysical processes. By no longer regarding the atmosphere and ocean model output as error-free, deeper insight into the impact of such uncertainties on the de-aliasing and on the resulting GRACE gravity field models can be obtained. For this purpose, in a first step, a full error propagation of the atmospheric and oceanic model parameters up to the de-aliasing gravity field coefficients is performed and the GRACE K-Band-Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (KBR-SST) residuals, as an intermediate gravity field result, are analysed. The paper reviews the standard GRACE de-aliasing process and presents the mathematical model applied for the error propagation. Specifically, the effect of uncertainties in the atmospheric input parameters (temperature, surface pressure, specific humidity, geopotential) on the gravity field potential coefficients used for de-aliasing is shown in several scenarios. Finally, the impact of de-aliasing products (with and without error propagation) on a GRACE gravity field solution is investigated on the level of observation residuals. From the results obtained in this study it can be concluded that with respect to the current GRACE error budget, atmospheric model uncertainties do not play a prominent role in the error budget of current GRACE gravity field solutions. Nevertheless, in order to fully exploit the GRACE measurements towards the baseline accuracy, an optimized de-aliasing is needed. In this case, GRACE gravity field solutions are sensitive to uncertainties in atmospheric and oceanic models. Thus, the associated geophysical model errors shall be taken into account in the de-aliasing process.},

abstract = {A navigation scenario involving two satellites orbiting the asteroid 433 Eros is studied. Using relative radiometric measurement types between both satellites, absolute orbit de-termination is achieved. Recent research has shown that for satellites in libration point orbits, satellite-to-satellite tracking is enough to estimate the absolute state of all satellites involved due to the asymmetry of the gravity field. In this study, the asymmetry in the gravity field of Eros is used to achieve similar results. The purpose of this application is not to provide a highly-accurate representation of the gravity field, but demonstrate that absolute orbit determination may be accomplished using inter-satellite observations in the presence of an unknown gravity field. The satellite constellation studied utilizes inter-satellite observations and minimal Earth based radiometric observations to obtain accurate corrections to both satellites' state and corrections to the spherical harmonic gravity model up to degree and order 5. A Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao Bound analysis shows that the system is observable even with significant uncertainties in the initial state. Final filter state solutions reveal that the uncertainty of the satellites' position 3D-RMS is less than 56 m and the velocity is less than 0.006 m/s over 9 days of observation processing.},

In this study, a multi-satellite approach is proposed to estimate the water stored in the floodplains of the Orinoco Basin at a monthly time-scale using remotely-sensed observations of surface water from the Global Inundation Extent Multi-Satellite (GIEMS) and stages from Envisat radar altimetry. Surface water storage variations over 2003–2007 exhibit large interannual variability and a strong seasonal signal, peaking during summer, and associated with the flood pulse. The volume of surface water storage in the Orinoco Basin was highly correlated with the river discharge at Ciudad Bolivar (R = 0.95), the closest station to the mouth where discharge was estimated, although discharge lagged one month behind storage. The correlation remained high (R = 0.73) after removing seasonal effects. Mean annual variations in surface water volume represented $\sim$170 km3, contributing to $\sim$45% of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived total water storage variations and representing $\sim$13% of the total volume of water that flowed out of the Orinoco Basin to the Atlantic Ocean.},

abstract = {Kinematic positions of Low Earth Orbiters based on GPS tracking are frequently used as pseudo-observations for single satellite gravity field determination. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the satellite trajectory is partly limited because the receiver synchronization error has to be estimated along with the kinematic coordinates at every observation epoch. We review the requirements for GPS receiver clock modeling in Precise Point Positioning (PPP) and analyze its impact on kinematic orbit determination for the two satellites of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission using both simulated and real data. We demonstrate that a piecewise linear parameterization can be used to model the ultra-stable oscillators that drive the GPS receivers on board of the GRACE satellites. Using such a continuous clock model allows position estimation even if the number of usable GPS satellites drops to three and improves the robustness of the solution with respect to outliers. Furthermore, simulations indicate a potential accuracy improvement of the satellite trajectory of at least 40 % in the radial direction and up to 7 % in the along-track and cross-track directions when a 60-s piecewise linear clock model is estimated instead of epoch-wise independent receiver clock offsets. For PPP with real GRACE data, the accuracy evaluation is hampered by the lack of a reference orbit of significantly higher accuracy. However, comparisons with a smooth reduced-dynamic orbit indicate a significant reduction of the high-frequency noise in the radial component of the kinematic orbit. 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Cheng2013a,
abstract = {For over three decades, satellite laser ranging (SLR) has recorded the global nature of the long-wavelength mass change within the Earth system. Analysis of the most recent time series of 30 day SLR-based estimates of Earth's dynamical oblateness, characterized by the gravitational degree-2 zonal spherical harmonic J2, indicates that the long-term variation of J2 appears to be more quadratic than linear in nature. The superposition of a quadratic and an 18.6 year variation leads to the “unknown decadal variation” reported by Cheng and Tapley (2004). Although the primary trend is expected to be linear due to global isostatic adjustment, there is an evident deceleration (J¨2=18±1×10−13/yr2) in the rate of the decrease in J2 during the last few decades, likely due to changes in the rate of the global mass redistribution from melting of the glaciers and ice sheets as well as mass changes in the atmosphere and ocean.},

It is found, in particular, that (i) the largest negative trends, which are associated with shrinking ice sheets in polar areas, reach 18{\^{a}}€“20 cm in terms of water height per year; (ii) the largest positive trends, which are presumably related to the post-glacial rebound, reach 7{\^{a}}€“9 cm/year; (iii) the largest peak-to-peak seasonal variations, which are mostly observed in large river basins, reach 50{\^{a}}€“100 cm/year. Furthermore, the confidence of secular trends is computed per point in order to isolate persistent trends. The set of locations where relatively small but persistent trends are observed includes Svalbard archipelago, Pamir mountains, Congo watershed, and Enderby Land in Antarctica.},

abstract = {The natural spectrum of electromagnetic variations surrounding Earth extends across an enormous frequency range and is controlled by diverse physical processes. Electromagnetic (EM) induction studies make use of external field variations with frequencies ranging from the solar cycle which has been used for geomagnetic depth sounding through the 10−4–104 Hz frequency band widely used for magnetotelluric and audio-magnetotelluric studies. Above 104 Hz, the EM spectrum is dominated by man-made signals. This review emphasizes electromagnetic sources at ∼1 Hz and higher, describing major differences in physical origin and structure of short- and long-period signals. The essential role of Earth's internal magnetic field in defining the magnetosphere through its interactions with the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field is briefly outlined. At its lower boundary, the magnetosphere is engaged in two-way interactions with the underlying ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. Extremely low-frequency (3 Hz–3 kHz) electromagnetic signals are generated in the form of sferics, lightning, and whistlers which can extend to frequencies as high as the VLF range (3–30 kHz).The roughly spherical dielectric cavity bounded by the ground and the ionosphere produces the Schumann resonance at around 8 Hz and its harmonics. A transverse resonance also occurs at 1.7–2.0 kHz arising from reflection off the variable height lower boundary of the ionosphere and exhibiting line splitting due to three-dimensional structure. Ground and satellite observations are discussed in the light of their contributions to understanding the global electric circuit and for EM induction studies.},

abstract = {In the last decade, satellite gravimetry has been revealed as a pioneering technique for mapping mass redistributions within the Earth system. This fact has allowed us to have an improved understanding of the dynamic processes that take place within and between the Earth's various constituents. Results from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission have revolutionized Earth system research and have established the necessity for future satellite gravity missions. In 2010, a comprehensive team of European and Canadian scientists and industrial partners proposed the e.motion (Earth system mass transport mission) concept to the European Space Agency. The proposal is based on two tandem satellites in a pendulum orbit configuration at an altitude of about 370 km, carrying a laser interferometer inter-satellite ranging instrument and improved accelerometers. In this paper, we review and discuss a wide range of mass signals related to the global water cycle and to solid Earth deformations that were outlined in the e.motion proposal. The technological and mission challenges that need to be addressed in order to detect these signals are emphasized within the context of the scientific return. This analysis presents a broad perspective on the value and need for future satellite gravimetry missions.},

@article{Klinger2016b,
abstract = {For more than 14 years, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has provided information about Earth's gravity field with unprecedented accuracy. The twin satellites GRACE-A and GRACE-B are both equipped with a three-axis electrostatic accelerometer, measuring the non-gravitational forces acting on the spacecraft. In order to make use of the uncalibrated Level-1B accelerometer (ACC1B) data during gravity field recovery, bias and scale parameters have to be estimated. The proposed calibration method is a two-step approach and makes use of modeled non-conservative accelerations. The simulated non-conservative accelerations serve as reference for the a priori accelerometer calibration, i.e. for the ACC1B data. During gravity field recovery the calibration parameters are re-estimated. Several calibration parameters for the GRACE accelerometers using different methods have already been published. The aim of our study was primarily to analyze the temperature-dependent behavior of the accelerometer scale factors and biases, and the impact of the parametrization of scale factors and biases on the recovered gravity field solutions; but not to obtain calibrated accelerometer data. Within the ITSG-Grace2016 release, the accelerometer biases are estimated daily using uniform cubic basis splines (UCBS), the scale factors are also estimated daily using a fully-populated scale factor matrix. Therefore, not only the scale factors in along-track, cross-track, and radial direction are estimated, but also the non-orthogonality of the accelerometer axes (cross-talk) and the misalignment between the Accelerometer Frame (AF) and Science Reference Frame (SRF) are taken into account. The time evolution of the estimated calibration parameters over the whole GRACE period (2002-04 to 2016-01) shows a clear temperature-dependency for both scale factors and biases. Using this new approach, the estimates of the C20 coefficient significantly improve, with results now comparable to Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) solutions. Based on the achieved results, we suggest the presence of a clear temperature-dependent behavior and the presence of off-diagonal elements in the accelerometer scale factor matrix.},

abstract = {We propose to validate regional solutions consisting of 2° surface tiles of surface mass concentration over South America (90°W-30°W; 60°S-20°N) computed using accurate Level-1 GRACE measurements, by confronting them to other GRACE products (. i.e., global GRGS and ICA-400. km GFZ/CSR/JPL combined solutions) and independent in situ river level and discharge datasets. For this purpose, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to all of these types of GRACE-based solutions to extract the corresponding main orthogonal spatial and temporal modes of variability to be compared for 2003-2010. For the first three spatial modes, regional solutions provide a better geographical localization of hydrological structures, especially indicating major surface and groundwater systems of South America. Over hydrological patterns, records of river level versus time are particularly consistent with the GRACE temporal modes, especially for our regional solutions (. i.e., correlations generally greater than 0.7). Interannual variations of GRACE-based Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) clearly exhibit the signatures of extreme climatic events as the recent droughts and floods that affected South America. Very significant agreement is also found at interannual time-scale between TWS and discharges in drainage basins dominated by the surface reservoir (more than 0.9 of correlation in the Amazon basin).{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) of the ocean provides valuable information about the ocean's surface currents. Therefore the MDT is computed from satellite observations and then assimilated into ocean models in order to improve the ocean circulation estimates. However, the computation of the MDT from satellite observations of sea surface height and the Earth's gravity field is not straightforward and requires additional filtering of the data combination. The choice of the filter is crucial as it determines the amount of small-scale noise in the data and the resolution of the final MDT. There exist various approaches for the determination of an "optimal" filter. However, they all have in common the more or less subjective choice of the filter type and filter width. Here, a new filter is presented that is determined directly from the geodetic normal equations. By its construction, this filter accurately accounts for the correlations within the MDT data and requires no subjective choice about the filter radius. The new filtered MDT is assimilated into an inverse ocean model. Modifications in the meridional overturning circulation and in the poleward heat transports can be observed, compared to the result of the assimilation using the unfiltered MDT. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Observations of the perturbations of total electron content (TEC) caused by a powerful radio emission of "Sura" facility (Radio Physical Research Institute, N. Novgorod) were carried out during several experimental campaigns from March of 2010 to March 2013. In this paper the data of experimental measurements of TEC-variations conducted on March, 15, 2010 and on March, 12, 2013, are presented. Parameters of TEC-variations were obtained by dual-frequency global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) diagnostics. Registration of signal parameters from GNSS-transmitters was performed at spatially separated sites along the geomagnetic latitude: Vasilsursk (56??08???N, 46??05??? E), Zelenodolsk (55??52???N, 48??33???E) and Kazan (55??48???N, 49??08???E). In the experiments radio path from GNSS satellite to Vasilsursk passed over the disturbed region of ionosphere, but radio paths to Zelenodolsk and to Kazan did not. However, TEC-variations correlated with pumping of ionosphere by "Sura" facility were detected for all up to three ground measurements sites. Magnitudes of TEC-variations reached up to ???0.6-0.7 TECU. The speculation that a sharp gradient of the electron density formed at the border of the main lobe of "Sura" facility may cause the generation of IGW is presented.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s).Satellite laser ranging (SLR) to the satellites of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provides substantial and valuable information about the accuracy and quality of GNSS orbits and allows for the SLR-GNSS co-location in space. In the framework of the NAVSTAR-SLR experiment two GPS satellites of Block-IIA were equipped with laser retroreflector arrays (LRAs), whereas all satellites of the GLONASS system are equipped with LRAs in an operational mode. We summarize the outcome of the NAVSTAR-SLR experiment by processing 20 years of SLR observations to GPS and 12 years of SLR observations to GLONASS satellites using the reprocessed microwave orbits provided by the center for orbit determination in Europe (CODE). The dependency of the SLR residuals on the size, shape, and number of corner cubes in LRAs is studied. We show that the mean SLR residuals and the RMS of residuals depend on the coating of the LRAs and the block or type of GNSS satellites. The SLR mean residuals are also a function of the equipment used at SLR stations including the single-photon and multi-photon detection modes. We also show that the SLR observations to GNSS satellites are important to validate GNSS orbits and to assess deficiencies in the solar radiation pressure models. We found that the satellite signature effect, which is defined as a spread of optical pulse signals due to reflection from multiple reflectors, causes the variations of mean SLR residuals of up to 15 mm between the observations at nadir angles of 0$$^{\circ }$$<sup>∘</sup> and 14$$^{\circ }$$<sup>∘</sup>. in case of multi-photon SLR stations. For single-photon SLR stations this effect does not exceed 1 mm. When using the new empirical CODE orbit model (ECOM), the SLR mean residual falls into the range 0.1–1.8 mm for high-performing single-photon SLR stations observing GLONASS-M satellites with uncoated corner cubes. For best-performing multi-photon stations the mean SLR residuals are between $$-12.2$$-12.2 and $$-25.6$$-25.6 mm due to the satellite signature effect.},

abstract = {By linear perturbation theory, a sensitivity study is presented to calculate the contribution of the Mars gravity field to the orbital perturbations in velocity for spacecrafts in both low eccentricity Mars orbits and high eccentricity orbits (HEOs). In order to improve the solution of some low degree/order gravity coefficients, a method of choosing an appropriate semimajor axis is often used to calculate an expected orbital resonance, which will significantly amplify the magnitude of the position and velocity perturbations produced by certain gravity coefficients. We can then assess to what degree/order gravity coefficients can be recovered from the tracking data of the spacecraft. However, this existing method can only be applied to a low eccentricity orbit, and is not valid for an HEO. A new approach to choosing an appropriate semimajor axis is proposed here to analyze an orbital resonance. This approach can be applied to both low eccentricity orbits and HEOs. This small adjustment in the semimajor axis can improve the precision of gravity field coefficients and does not affect other scientific objectives.},

The EGM2008 global geopotential model has been used up to degree and order 360 in order to create gravity anomaly fields on both the sphere and the ellipsoid as the function fields of the current investigation. Harmonic analysis has then been carried out to compute the dimensionless potential coeficients using the created function fields. Three different harmonic analysis techniques have been applied: the least-squares technique, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique and the Gauss-Legendre numerical integration technique. The computed coeficients in spherical harmonics have then been compared with EGM2008 (in the frequency domain) and the computed fields on the sphere and the ellipsoid have been compared with fields created by EGM2008 up to degree and order 360 (in the space domain) in order to estimate the accuracy of the three different harmonic analysis techniques used within the current investigation. The results proved that the least-squares technique gives the best accuracy both in frequency and space domain. The FFT technique provides quite good results in a very short cpu time. The Gauss-Legendre technique gives the worst results among the presented techniques, but still the residuals in the space domain are negligibly small. {\textcopyright} 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.},

abstract = {This paper presents the key elements of the next generation of miniaturised GNSS space receivers in the European Space Agency (ESA) compatible with the new and more robust GNSS signals from Galileo, modernized GPS, Glonass and Compass-Beidou. A quick review of applications like Precise Orbit Determination (POD) and Radio Occultation (RO) is provided together with the performance achieved in current satellites like MetOp or GOCE and expected in future ESA satellites. The key architectural building blocks of future GNSS space receivers are presented, with focus on components like the AGGA-4 baseband GNSS processor and also, but to a less extent, on programmable RF ASICs. These components, in combination with the more robust features from the new GNSS signals, bring a significant improvement with respect to their predecessors (e.g. AGGA-2 based) and also represent an important step towards miniaturisation of the next generation of GNSS space instruments.},

abstract = {An estimated orbit error budget for the Jason-1 and Jason-2 GDR-D solutions is constructed, using several measures of orbit error. The focus is on the long-term stability of the orbit time series for mean sea level applications on a regional scale. We discuss various issues related to the assessment of radial orbit error trends; in particular this study reviews orbit errors dependent on the tracking technique, with an aim to monitoring the long-term stability of all available tracking systems operating on Jason-1 and Jason-2 (GPS, DORIS, SLR). The reference frame accuracy and its effect on Jason orbit is assessed. We also examine the impact of analysis method on the inference of Geographically Correlated Errors as well as the significance of estimated radial orbit error trends versus the time span of the analysis. Thus a long-term error budget of the 10-year Jason-1 and Envisat GDR-D orbit time series is provided for two time scales: interannual and decadal. As the temporal variations of the geopotential remain one of the primary limitations in the Precision Orbit Determination modeling, the overall accuracy of the Jason-1 and Jason-2 GDR-D solutions is evaluated through comparison with external orbits based on different time-variable gravity models. This contribution is limited to an East-West "order-1" pattern at the 2 mm/y level (secular) and 4 mm level (seasonal), over the Jason-2 lifetime. The possibility of achieving sub-mm/y radial orbit stability over interannual and decadal periods at regional scales and the challenge of evaluating such an improvement using in situ independent data is discussed.},

abstract = {Thermospheric density models are currently the main source of error in the orbit determination and prediction of low Earth satellites. The empirical models which are in wide use today show an RMS accuracy of no better than 15-30%. This accuracy barrier is thought to be inherent in the model formulation, which is based on an imperfect correlation of density with space weather proxies. This barrier can be overcome by using model calibration. Selected correction parameters can be estimated using concurrent observations of satellite drag. We have investigated the derivation of accurate density values from satellite orbit data and tracking measurements, and the subsequent adjustment of the CIRA-72 model using these data. Two sources were investigated to compute integrated density values along satellite orbits. The first source is a limited number of satellites with highly accurate tracking systems, such as altimetry and gravity missions. The very large database of two-line element data can be used a second option. The influence on accuracy of uncertainties in other forces, the ballistic coefficients and thermospheric winds, has been assessed. {\textcopyright} 2005 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We explore the cosmological implications of five modified gravity (MG) models by using the recent cosmological observational data, including the recently released SNLS3 type Ia supernovae sample, the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-yr observations, the baryon acoustic oscillation results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7, and the latest Hubble constant measurement utilizing the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope. The MG models considered include the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati(DGP) model, two $f(R)$ models, and two $f(T)$ models. We find that compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model, MG models can not lead to a appreciable reduction of the $\chi^2_{min}$. The analysis of AIC and BIC shows that the simplest cosmological constant model($\Lambda$CDM) is still most preferred by the current data, and the DGP model is strongly disfavored. In addition, from the observational constraints, we also reconstruct the evolutions of the growth factor in these models. We find that the current available growth factor data are not enough to distinguish these MG models from the $\Lambda$CDM model.},

abstract = {We evaluate performance of the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) under flood conditions after the assimilation of observations of the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Assimilation offers three key benefits for the viability of GRACE observations to operational applications: (1) near-real time analysis; (2) a downscaling of GRACE's coarse spatial resolution; and (3) state disaggregation of the vertically-integrated TWSA. We select the 2011 flood event in the Missouri river basin as a case study, and find that assimilation generally made the model wetter in the months preceding flood. We compare model outputs with observations from 14 USGS groundwater wells to assess improvements after assimilation. Finally, we examine disaggregated water storage information to improve the mechanistic understanding of event generation. Validation establishes that assimilation improved the model skill substantially, increasing regional groundwater anomaly correlation from 0.58 to 0.86. For the 2011 flood event in the Missouri river basin, results show that groundwater and snow water equivalent were contributors to pre-event flood potential, providing spatially-distributed early warning information.},

abstract = {During its reentry phase from 21 October to 10 November 2013, the European Space Agency (ESA) Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) continued to provide high-quality, dual-frequency observations by its Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, star tracker and accelerometers. This resulted in a unique data set for testing high-precision orbit determination at altitudes down to as low as 137km. In addition, the accelerometers kept working down to this altitude as well, be it with growing periods during which they were saturated. This made it possible to test the capability of estimating non-gravitational accelerations in high drag environments by GPS. A reduced-dynamic orbit determination based on an extended Kalman filter approach was adopted to cope with the estimation of the orbit parameters, including the exponentially growing non-gravitational accelerations. The orbits were found to be consistent with Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) observations at a level of just a few centimeters for a few passes collected up to 2 November 2013. Also orbit overlap comparisons and comparisons with external orbit solutions indicate a 3-dimensional orbit quality at the dm level or better. In addition, high correlations were found between the estimated non-gravitational accelerations and those from the accelerometers during all periods when they were not saturated: typically close to 0.99 for the X axis of the gradiometer reference frame (close to the flight direction), for which the non-gravitational acceleration signal is by far the largest. High correlations were found as well for the Y axis (0.68–0.96) and Z axis (0.61–0.93), predominantly aligned with respectively the cross-track and height direction. The highest correlations were found for the last days, as long as the accelerometers were not saturated.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects.

abstract = {Four different basin functions are developed to estimate water storage variations within individual river basins from time variations in the Stokes coefficients now available from the GRACE mission. The four basin functions are evaluated using simulated data. Basin functions differ in how they minimize effects of three major error sources: measurement error; leakage of signal from one region to another; and errors in the atmospheric pressure field removed during GRACE data processing. Three of the basin functions are constant in time, while the fourth changes monthly using information about the signal (hydrologic and oceanic load variations). To test basin functions performance, Stokes coefficient variations from land and ocean models are synthesized, and error levels 50 and 100 times greater than pre-launch GRACE error estimate are used to corrupt them. Errors at 50 times pre-launch estimates approximately simulate current GRACE data. GRACE recovery of water storage variations is attempted for five different river basins (Amazon, Mississippi, Lena, Huang He and Oranje), representing a variety of sizes, locations, and signal variance. In the large basins (Amazon, Mississippi and Lena), water storage variations are recovered successfully at both error levels. As the error level increases from 50 to 100 times, basin functions change their shape, yielding less atmospheric pressure error and more leakage error. Amplitude spectra of measurement and atmospheric pressure errors have different shapes, but the best results are obtained when both are used in basin function design. When high-quality information about the signal is available, for example from climate and ocean models, changing the basin function each month can reduce leakage error and improve estimates of time variable water storage within basins.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of global positioning\nsystem (GPS) receivers for relative positioning of formation-flying\nsatellites using dual-frequency carrier-phase observations. The accurate\ndetermination of distances or baselines between satellites flying\nin formation can provide significant benefits to a wide area of geodetic\nstudies. For spaceborne radar interferometry in particular, such\nmeasurements will improve the accuracy of interferometric products\nsuch as digital elevation models (DEM) or surface deformation maps.\nThe aim of this study is to analyze the impact of relative position\nerrors on the interferometric baseline performance of multistatic\nsynthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites flying in such a formation.\nBased on accuracy results obtained from differential GPS (DGPS) observations\nbetween the twin gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE)\nsatellites, baseline uncertainties are derived for three interferometric\nscenarios of a dedicated SAR mission. For cross-track interferometry\nin a bistatic operational mode, a mean 2D baseline error (1??) of\n1.4 mm is derived, whereas baseline estimates necessary for a monostatic\nacquisition mode with a 50 km along-track separation reveal a 2D\nuncertainty of approximately 1.7 mm. Absolute orbit solutions based\non reduced dynamic orbit determination techniques using GRACE GPS\ncode and carrier-phase data allows a repeat-pass baseline estimation\nwith an accuracy down to 4 cm (2D 1??). To assess the accuracy with\nrespect to quality requirements of high-resolution DEMs, topographic\nheight errors are derived from the estimated baseline uncertainties.\nTaking the monostatic pursuit flight configuration as the worst case\nfor baseline performance, the analysis reveals that the induced low-frequency\nmodulation (height bias) fulfills the relative vertical accuracy\nrequirement (??<1 m linear point-to-point error) according to the\ndigital terrain elevation data level 3 (DTED-3) specifications for\nmost of the baseline constellations. The use of a GPS-based reduced\ndynamic orbit determination technique improves the baseline performance\nfor repeat-pass interferometry. The problem of fulfilling the DTED-3\nhorizontal accuracy requirements is still an issue to be investigated.\nDGPS can be used as an operational navigation tool for high-precision\nbaseline estimation if a geodetic-grade dual-frequency spaceborne\nGPS receiver is assumed to be the primary instrument onboard the\nSAR satellites. The possibility of using only single-frequency receivers,\nhowever, requires further research effort. ?� Springer-Verlag 2006.},

Very recent algorithms have been selected among the pioneering studies adopting a new methodology and the most promising solutions. After introducing the concept of super-resolution and modeling the approach as a constrained optimization problem, different SR solutions for spatio-temporal fusion and pan-sharpening are reviewed and critically discussed. Concerning pan-sharpening, the well-known, simple, yet effective, proportional additive wavelet in the luminance component (AWLP) is adopted as a benchmark to assess the performance of the new SR-based pan-sharpening methods. The widespread quality indexes computed at degraded resolution, with the original multispectral image used as the reference, i.e., SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper) and ERGAS (Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synth{\`{e}}se), are finally presented. Considering these results, sparse representation and Bayesian approaches seem far from being mature to be adopted in operational pan-sharpening scenarios.},

abstract = {Laser ranging is an emerging technology for tracking interplanetary missions, offering both range accuracy and precision at the level of several millimeters. The ground segment uses existing Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) technology, whereas the space segment requires an active system for either one- or two-way ranging. We numerically investigate the performance of one- and two-way active planetary laser ranging systems to quantify the difference in science return from missions employing this technology. In doing so, we assess the added value of the more complicated two-way system compared to its one-way counterpart. We simulate range measurement errors for both types of systems, using clock error time histories generated from Allan variance profiles. We use two test cases: a lunar polar orbiter and a Phobos lander. In the Phobos lander simulations, we include the estimation of Phobos librations and C??2,2 gravity field coefficient. For the lunar orbiter, we include an empirical force-error model in our truth model. We include the estimation of clock parameters over a variety of arc lengths for one-way range data analysis and use a variety of state arc durations for the lunar orbiter simulations. For the lunar orbiter, performance of the one- and two-way system is similar for sufficiently short clock arcs. This indicates that dynamical-model error, not clock noise, is the dominant source of estimation uncertainty. However, correlations between the clock and state parameters cause an exchange between clock and state signal for the one-way system, making these results less robust. The results for the Phobos lander show superior estimation accuracy of the two-way system. However, knowledge of Phobos' interior mass distribution from both the one- or two-way system would currently be limited to the same level by inaccuracies in our knowledge of Phobos' volume. Both the lunar orbiter and Phobos lander simulations show that the use of two-way planetary laser ranging should be accompanied by improvements in associated measurements and models to allow this data type to be exploited to its full potential.},

The receiver noise and ionospheric effects assessment, the ambiguity resolution as well as the relative positioning performance are investigated. Results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the convergence to the correct ambiguities by 2 or 3 measurement epochs with the local vertical ionospheric delay for each satellite included in the estimator state, and that millimeter level relative positioning precision can benefit from considering differential ionospheric effects.},

abstract = {Time series of geocenter coordinates were determined with data of two global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), namely the U.S. GPS (Global Positioning System) and the Russian GLONASS (Global'naya Nawigatsionnaya Sputnikowaya Sistema). The data was recorded in the years 2008–2011 by a global network of 92 permanently observing GPS/GLONASS receivers. Two types of daily solutions were generated independently for each GNSS, one including the estimation of geocenter coordinates and one without these parameters. A fair agreement for GPS and GLONASS was found in the geocenter x- and y-coordinate series. Our tests, however, clearly reveal artifacts in the z-component determined with the GLONASS data. Large periodic excursions in the GLONASS geocenter z-coordinates of about 40cm peak-to-peak are related to the maximum elevation angles of the Sun above/below the orbital planes of the satellite system and thus have a period of about 4 months (third of a year). A detailed analysis revealed that the artifacts are almost uniquely governed by the differences of the estimates of direct solar radiation pressure (SRP) in the two solution series (with and without geocenter estimation). A simple formula is derived, describing the relation between the geocenter z-coordinate and the corresponding parameter of the SRP. The effect can be explained by first-order perturbation theory of celestial mechanics. The theory also predicts a heavy impact on the GNSS-derived geocenter if once-per-revolution SRP parameters are estimated in the direction of the satellite's solar panel axis. Specific experiments using GPS observations revealed that this is indeed the case. Although the main focus of this article is on GNSS, the theory developed is applicable to all satellite observing techniques. We applied the theory to satellite laser ranging (SLR) solutions using LAGEOS. It turns out that the correlation between geocenter and SRP parameters is not a critical issue for the SLR solutions. The reasons are threefold: The direct SRP is about a factor of 30–40 smaller for typical geodetic SLR satellites than for GNSS satellites, allowing it in most cases to not solve for SRP parameters (ruling out the correlation between these parameters and the geocenter coordinates); the orbital arc length of 7 days (which is typically used in SLR analysis) contains more than 50 revolutions of the LAGEOS satellites as compared to about two revolutions of GNSS satellites for the daily arcs used in GNSS analysis; the orbit geometry is not as critical for LAGEOS as for GNSS satellites, because the elevation angle of the Sun w.r.t. the orbital plane is usually significantly changing over 7 days.},

Numerous statistical and probabilistic tools (regression, smoothing, tests, statistical learning, Monte Carlo, {\ldots}) aim at determining the model input variables which mostly contribute to an interest quantity depending on model output. This quantity can be for instance the variance of an output variable. Three kinds of methods are distinguished: the screening (coarse sorting of the most influential inputs among a large number), the measures of importance (quantitative sensitivity indices) and the deep exploration of the model behaviour (measuring the effects of inputs on their all variation range). A progressive application methodology is illustrated on a scholar application. A synthesis is given to place every method according to several axes, mainly the cost in number of model evaluations, the model complexity and the nature of brought information.},

abstract = {National height reference systems have conventionally been linked to the local mean sea level, observed at individual tide gauges. Due to variations in the sea surface topography, the reference levels of these systems are inconsistent, causing height datum offsets of up to {\textpm}1--2 m. For the unification of height systems, a satellite-based method is presented that utilizes global geopotential models (GGMs) derived from ESA's satellite mission Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE). In this context, height datum offsets are estimated within a least squares adjustment by comparing the GGM information with measured GNSS/leveling data. While the GNSS/leveling data comprises the full spectral information, GOCE GGMs are restricted to long wavelengths according to the maximum degree of their spherical harmonic representation. To provide accurate height datum offsets, it is indispensable to account for the remaining signal above this maximum degree, known as the omission error of the GGM. Therefore, a combination of the GOCE information with the high-resolution Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008) is performed. The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the benefit, when high-frequency topography-implied gravity signals are additionally used to reduce the remaining omission error of EGM2008. In terms of a spectral extension, a new method is proposed that does not rely on an assumed spectral consistency of topographic heights and implied gravity as is the case for the residual terrain modeling (RTM) technique. In the first step of this new approach, gravity forward modeling based on tesseroid mass bodies is performed according to the Rock--Water--Ice (RWI) approach. In a second step, the resulting full spectral RWI-based topographic potential values are reduced by the effect of the topographic gravity field model RWI{_}TOPO{_}2015, thus, removing the long to medium wavelengths. By using the latest GOCE GGMs, the impact of topography-implied gravity signals on the estimation of height datum offsets is analyzed in detail for representative GNSS/leveling data sets in Germany, Austria, and Brazil. Besides considerable changes in the estimated offset of up to 3 cm, the conducted analyses show that significant improvements of 30--40{%} can be achieved in terms of a reduced standard deviation and range of the least squares adjusted residuals.},

@article{Alizadeh2015a,
abstract = {For space geodetic techniques, operating in microwave band, ionosphere is a dispersive medium; thus, signals traveling through this medium are in the first approximation, affected proportional to the inverse of the square of their frequencies. This effect allows gaining information about the parameters of the ionosphere in terms of total electron content (TEC) or the electron density (Ne). Making use of this phenomenon, space geodetic techniques have turned into a capable tool for studying the ionosphere in the last decades. Up to now, two-dimensional (2-D) models of Vertical TEC (VTEC) have been widely developed and used by different communities; however, due to the fact that these models provide information about the integral of the whole electron content along the vertical or slant raypath, these maps are not useful when information about the ionosphere at different altitude is required. This paper presents a recent study which aims at developing a global 3-D model of the electron density, using measurements from Global Navigation Satellite Systems and by applying the ray tracing technique to the upper atmosphere. The developed modeling approach represents the horizontal variations of the electron density, with two sets of spherical harmonic expansions of degree and order 15. The height dependency of the electron density is represented by a multilayered Chapman profile function for the bottomside and topside ionosphere, and an appropriate model for the plasmasphere. In addition to the geodetic applications of the developed models, within this study, the 3-D models of electron density can include geophysical parameters like maximum electron density and its corresponding height. High-resolution modeling of these parameters allows an improved geophysical interpretation, which is essential in all studies of the upper atmosphere, space weather, and for the solar-terrestrial environment.},

abstract = {We present a global static model of the Earth's gravity field entitled DGM-1S based on GRACE and GOCE data. The collection of used data sets includes nearly 7 years of GRACE KBR data and 10 months of GOCE gravity gradient data. The KBR data are transformed with a 3-point differentiation into quantities that are approximately inter-satellite accelerations. Gravity gradients are processed in the instrumental frame. Noise is handled with a frequency-dependent data weighting. DGM-1S is complete to spherical harmonic degree 250 with a Kaula regularization being applied above degree 179. Its performance is compared with a number of other satellite-only GRACE/GOCE models by confronting them with (i) an independent model of the oceanic mean dynamic topography, and (ii) independent KBR and gravity gradient data. The tests reveal a competitive quality for DGM-1S. Importantly, we study added value of GOCE data by comparing the performance of satellite-only GRACE/GOCE models with models produced without GOCE data: either ITG-Grace2010s or EGM2008 depending on which of the two performs better in a given region. The test executed based on independent gravity gradients quantifies this added value as 25-38 % in the continental areas poorly covered with terrestrial gravimetry data (Equatorial Africa, Himalayas, and South America), 7-17 % in those with a good coverage with these data (Australia, North America, and North Eurasia), and 14 % in the oceans. This added value is shown to be almost entirely related to coefficients below degree 200. It is shown that this gain must be entirely attributed to gravity gradients acquired by the mission. The test executed based on an independent model of the mean dynamic topography suggests that problems still seem to exist in satellite-only GRACE/GOCE models over the Pacific ocean, where noticeable deviations between these models and EGM2008 are detected, too.},

abstract = {A new Earth Gravitational Model (EGM2008) to degree 2160 has been developed, from the final re-iteration of our modelling approach that has produced several Pre- liminary Gravitational Models (PGM) of increasingly better performance. Of these models, PGM2007A was evaluated by an international Working Group, sponsored by the Int'l Association of Geodesy (IAG). EGM2008 incorporates improved 5x5 minute gravity anomalies and has benefited from the latest GRACE based satellite solutions. EGM2008 also incorporates improved altimetry-derived gravity anomalies estimated using PGM2007B (a variant of PGM2007A) and its implied Dynamic Ocean Topogra- phy (DOT) model as reference. For the Collocation prediction of the final 5x5 minute mean gravity anomalies, we used PGM2007B as our reference model, and employed a formulation that predicts area-mean gravity anomalies which are effectively band- limited to degree 2160. This minimizes aliasing effects during the harmonic analysis process. We have placed special emphasis on the calibration of our model's error es- timates. We will present the main aspects of our model's development and the results from our own evaluation of EGM2008. This was done through the comparison of various model derived quantities with independent data and models (e.g., geoid undu- lations derived from GPS/levelling, deflections of the vertical, DOT from ECCO, etc.). Finally, we will discuss the availability of EGM2008, which will also be provided to the IAG Working Group for evaluation.},

abstract = {Concerns about North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (NAMOC) changes imply the need for a continuous, large-scale observation capability to detect changes on interannual to decadal time scales. Here we present the first measurements of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW) transport changes using only time-variable gravity observations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites from 2003 until now. Improved monthly gravity field retrievals allow the detection of North Atlantic interannual bottom pressure anomalies and LNADW transport estimates that are in good agreement with those from the Rapid Climate Change-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array (RAPID/MOCHA). Concurrent with the observed AMOC transport anomalies from late 2009 through early 2010, GRACE measured ocean bottom pressures changes in the 3000–5000 m deep western North Atlantic on the order of 20 mm-H2O (200 Pa), implying a southward volume transport anomaly in that layer of approximately −5.5 sverdrup. Our results highlight the efficacy of space gravimetry for observing AMOC variations to evaluate latitudinal coherency and long-term variability. },

abstract = {Both single and dual frequency GPS relative navigation filters may benefit from proper predictions of single differenced ionospheric delays. In this article, the single differenced ionospheric delays of GPS observations are predicted for the GRACE formation during the switch manoeuvre. Two prediction methods are considered. The first is based on a Taylor expansion to first order of a mapping function that maps slant total electron content measurements to vertical total electron content estimates. The second method fits a shape profile through undifferenced ionospheric data available. It then raytraces through this profile to estimate the difference in total electron content along the path of the GPS signals. Continuously changing ionospheric conditions hamper the assessment of the quality of the predictions. Comparison of both methods shows that the raytracing method performs better. The difference of predictions and measurements generally shows a smaller RMS than the measurements alone. However, both methods suffer from a number of systematically unpredicted observations, which arise from small unaccounted differential variations in electron densities along the path of the GPS signals. These prediction methods perform better when spacecraft separation is small. Baselines considered here range from tens of kilometres down to several hundred metres. When smallest spacecraft separation occurs (0.4 km), the single differenced ionospheric delays exhibit RMS values of 0.0089 m. The first method shows a difference between measurements and predictions with an RMS of 0.0081 m. For the second method the difference RMS is found to be 0.0067 m. ?? 2009 COSPAR.},

@article{Chen2014,
abstract = {? 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.A new coarse-time Global Positioning System (GPS) positioning algorithm based on the use of Doppler and code-phase measurements is proposed and described. The proposed method was demonstrated to be essential for reducing the time to first fix and the power consumption in a GPS receiver. Only 1?ms of data is required to obtain a positioning fix with accuracy comparable to that of the traditional GPS navigation algorithm. The algorithm is divided into two parts. In the first part, the Doppler measurement of the GPS signal is used to determine the coarse user position. With proper constraints, the required time accuracy for the Doppler measurements can be relaxed to be as long as 12?h. In the second part of the algorithm, the accurate user position is calculated by means of the 1?ms code-phase data. The traditional tracking process is no longer necessary in the proposed algorithm. Using the acquired 1-ms code-phase measurement, the positioning accuracy was determined to be approximately a few tens of meters in our experimental results. However, if the data length is extended to 10?ms, the positioning accuracy can be improved to within 10?20?m, which is similar to that of the traditional GPS positioning method. Various experiments were conducted to verify the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Observations show that glaciers around the world are in retreat and losing mass. Internationally coordinated for over a century, glacier monitoring activities provide an unprecedented dataset of glacier observations from ground, air and space. Glacier studies generally select specific parts of these datasets to obtain optimal assessments of the mass-balance data relating to the impact that glaciers exercise on global sea-level fluctuations or on regional runoff. In this study we provide an overview and analysis of the main observational datasets compiled by the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS). The dataset on glacier front variations ($\sim$42 000 since 1600) delivers clear evidence that centennial glacier retreat is a global phenomenon. Intermittent readvance periods at regional and decadal scale are normally restricted to a subsample of glaciers and have not come close to achieving the maximum positions of the Little Ice Age (or Holocene). Glaciological and geodetic observations ($\sim$5200 since 1850) show that the rates of early 21st-century mass loss are without precedent on a global scale, at least for the time period observed and probably also for recorded history, as indicated also in reconstructions from written and illustrated documents. This strong imbalance implies that glaciers in many regions will very likely suffer further ice loss, even if climate remains stable.},

abstract = {This paper studies the relativemotion of satellite formation flying in arbi- trary elliptical orbits with no perturbation. The trajectories of the leader and follower satellites are projected onto the celestial sphere. These two projections and celestial equator intersect each other to form a spherical triangle, in which the vertex angles and arc-distances are used to describe the relative motion equations. This method is entitled the reference orbital element approach. Here the dimensionless distance is defined as the ratio of the maximal distance between the leader and follower satellites to the semi-major axis of the leader satellite. In close formations, this dimensionless distance, aswell as some vertex angles and arc-distances of this spherical triangle, and the orbital element differences are small quantities. A series of order-of-magnitude analyses about these quantities are conducted. Consequently, the relative motion equations are approximated by expansions truncated to the second order, i.e. square of the dimensionless distance. In order to study the problem of periodicity of relative motion, the semi-major axis of the follower is expanded as Taylor series around that of the leader, by regarding relative position and velocity as small quantities. Using this expansion, it is proved that the periodicity condition derived from Lawden's equations is equivalent to the condition that theTaylor series of order one is zero.The first-order relative motion equations, simplified from the second-order ones, possess the same forms as the periodic solutions of Lawden's equations. It is presented that the latter are further first-order approximations to the former; and moreover, compared with the latter more suitable to research spacecraft rendezvous and docking, the former are more suitable to research relative orbit configurations. The first-order relative motion equations are expanded as trigonometric series with eccentric anomaly as the angle variable. Except the terms of order one, the trigonometric series' amplitudes are geometric series, and corresponding phases are constant both in the radial and in-track directions. When the trajectory of the in-plane relative motion is similar to an ellipse, a method to seek this ellipse is presented. The advantage of this method is shown by an example.},

Proposed here is a programme to create a much greater understanding in this area through the deployment of a dedicated space asset along with coordinated ground stations, modelling and the creation of a highly accessible database. The space element would comprise 2 co-orbiting spacecraft (TwinSat) involving a microsatellite and a nanosatellite, each including a suite of science instruments appropriate to this study.

abstract = {Geodetic measurements of Antarctic solid Earth deformation include signals from plate rotation and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Through simulation, we investigate the degree to which these signals are separable within horizontal GPS site velocities that commonly define plate rotation estimates and that promise new constraints on models of GIA. Using a suite of GIA model predictions that incorporate both 1-D and 3-D Earth rheologies, we show that, given the present location of GPS sites within East Antarctica, unmodelled or mismodelled GIA signal within GPS velocities produces biased estimates of plate rotation. When biased plate rotation is removed from the GPS velocities, errors as large as 0.8 mm yr−1 are introduced; a value commonly larger than the predicted GIA signal magnitude. In the absence of reliable forward models of plate rotation or GIA then Antarctic geodetic velocities cannot totally and unambiguously constrain either process, especially GIA.},

abstract = {Two methods for computing gravitational potential difference (GPD) between the GRACE satellites using orbit data have been formulated based on energy integral; one in geocentric inertial frame (GIF) and another in Earth fixed frame (EFF). Here we present a rigorous theoretical formulation in EFF with particular emphasis on necessary approximations, provide a computational approach to mitigate the approximations to negligible level, and verify our approach using simulations. We conclude that a term neglected or ignored in all former work without verification should be retained. In our simulations, 2 cycle per revolution (CPR) errors are present in the GPD computed using our formulation, and empirical removal of the 2 CPR and lower frequency errors can improve the precisions of Stokes coefficients (SCs) of degree 3 and above by 1-2 orders of magnitudes. This is despite of the fact that the result without removing these errors is already accurate enough. Furthermore, the relation between data errors and their influences on GPD is analysed, and a formal examination is made on the possible precision that real GRACE data may attain. The result of removing 2 CPR errors may imply that, if not taken care of properly, the values of SCs computed by means of the energy integral method using real GRACE data may be seriously corrupted by aliasing errors from possibly very large 2 CPR errors based on two facts: (1) errors of [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"> manifest as 2 CPR errors in GPD and (2) errors of [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"> in GRACE data--the differences between the CSR monthly values of [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"> independently determined using GRACE and SLR are a reasonable measure of their magnitude--are very large. Our simulations show that, if 2 CPR errors in GPD vary from day to day as much as those corresponding to errors of [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"> from month to month, the aliasing errors of degree 15 and above SCs computed using a month's GPD data may attain a level comparable to the magnitude of gravitational potential variation signal that GRACE was designed to recover. Consequently, we conclude that aliasing errors from 2 CPR errors in real GRACE data may be very large if not properly handled; and therefore, we propose an approach to reduce aliasing errors from 2 CPR and lower frequency errors for computing SCs above degree 2.},

abstract = {The contributions from terrestrial water sources to sea-level rise, other than ice caps and glaciers, are highly uncertain and heavily debated1–5 . Recent assessments indicate that ground- water depletion (GWD) may become the most important posi- tive terrestrial contribution6–10 over thenext50years, probably equal in magnitude to the current contributions from glaciers and ice caps6 . However, the existing estimates assume that nearly 100% of groundwater extracted eventually ends up in the oceans. Owing to limited knowledge of the pathways and mechanisms governing the ultimate fate of pumped ground- water, the relative fraction of global GWD that contributes to sea-level rise remains unknown. Here, using a coupled climate–hydrological model11,12 simulation, we show that only 80%ofGWDends up in the ocean. An increase in runoff to the ocean accounts for roughly two-thirds, whereas the remainder results fromthe enhanced net flux of precipitation minus evap- oration over the ocean, due to increased atmospheric vapour transport fromthe land to the ocean. The contribution ofGWD to global sea-level rise amounted to 0.02 (±0.004)mmyr−1 in 1900 and increased to 0.27 (±0.04)mmyr−1 in 2000. This indicates that existing studies have substantially overesti- mated the contribution of GWD to global sea-level rise by a cumulative amount of at least 10mm during the twentieth century and early twenty-first century. With other terrestrial water contributions included, we estimate the net terrestrial water contribution during the period 1993–2010 to be +0.12 (±0.04)mmyr−1 ,suggesting that the net terrestrialwater con- tribution reported in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report report is probably overestimated by a factor of three.},

abstract = {We analyze the spatial sensitivities of terrestrial water storage and geoid height changes determined from the time-variable gravity observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellite mission. On the basis of 15 GRACE monthly gravity solutions, covering the period April 2002 to December 2003, we examine the effects of spatial smoothing at radii varying from 400 to 2000 km and conclude that a 800 km Gaussian smoothing radius is effective for GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage and produces the minimum RMS residuals over the land of the differences between GRACE results and estimated water storage change from a global land data assimilation system. For GRACE estimated geoid height change, the effective smoothing radius can go down to 600 km. When the annual (e.g., the sine and cosine) components are the primary concern, the effective spatial resolution can reach 600 and 400 km for GRACE estimated terrestrial water storage or geoid height change, respectively.},

abstract = {The ESA Living Planet Programme includes two types of complementary user driven missions: the research-oriented Earth Explorer missions and the operational service oriented Earth Watch missions. These missions are implemented through the Earth Observation Envelope Programme (EOEP) and the Earth Watch Programme, where the Earth Explorer missions are completely covered by the EOEP. Earth Explorer missions are divided into two classes, with Core missions being larger missions addressing complex issues of wide scientific interest, and Opportunity missions, which are smaller in terms of cost to ESA and address more limited issues. Both types of missions address the research objectives set out in the Living Planet Programme document (ESA SP-1227 1998), which describes the Agency's new strategy for Earth Observation in the post-2000 time frame. All Earth Explorer missions are proposed, defined, evaluated and recommended by the scientific community. Following a call for Core mission ideas in 2000 and selection of five of the ten proposals for pre-feasibility study, three of the candidates, EarthCARE, SPECTRA and WALES, were chosen for feasibility study in November 2001. In response to a call for Opportunity mission proposals in 2001, which resulted in 25 full proposals being submitted by early 2002, three mission candidates, ACE+, EGPM and Swarm, were also chosen for feasibility study. The Phase-A studies for all six Earth Explorer candidate missions are being finalised by early 2004, forming the basis for the Reports for Mission Selection for all six candidate missions. The Swarm candidate mission is based on the mission proposal co-written and submitted in 2002 by a team lead by Eigil Friis-Christensen, Hermann L{\"{u}}hr, and Gauthier Hulot. This Report for Mission Selection for Swarm was prepared based on contributions from the Mission Advisory group (MAG) consisting of: Angelo De Santis, Eigil Friis-Christensen, Andrew Jackson, Gauthier Hulot, Hermann L{\"{u}}hr, Michael Purucker, Markus Rothacher, and Pieter Visser. Parts of the Report have been prepared by the Executive based on input provided by the industrial Phase A contractors. Nils Olsen, Mioara Mandea, Susanne Vennerstr{\o}m, Terence Sabaka, Stefan Maus, Alexei Kuvshinov, Alan Thomson and all others, who participated in the supporting studies during Phase A, are acknowledged for their direct or indirect contributions to this report. A special expression of gratitude goes to John LaBrecque who made a vital contribution by supporting the studies performed by NASA scientists Michael Purucker and Terence Sabaka. The Report for Mission Selection for Swarm, together with those for the other five Earth Explorer candidate missions, is being circulated within the Earth Observation research community in preparation for a User Consultation Meeting at ESRIN, Frascati, Italy, in April 2004.},

abstract = {Orbit prediction of satellites is an important requirement for mission planning, spacecraft navigation, re-entry, orbital lifetime estimates, etc. The prediction becomes complicated in near Earth environment as Earth's gravitational field and atmosphere influences the orbit. The effects of atmosphere are difficult to determine, since the atmospheric density undergoes large fluctuations. Method of KS elements was employed to generate analytical solutions with different atmospheric models. Particular form of KS elements known as uniformly regular KS canonical elements are used to generate number of analytical solutions with different atmospheric models, which are found to be better than KS theory. But, all are for low eccentric (e<0.2) orbits only. In this paper, a non singular analytical theory for the motion of Earth satellite for high eccentricity orbits (e>0.2) in an oblate exponential atmosphere using uniformly regular KS canonical elements is developed, and integrated with the low eccentricity theory. Due to symmetry, only two of the ten equations need to be solved analytically to get complete solutions. Comparison of the important orbital parameters semi-major axis and eccentricity, which define the size and shape of orbit with KS theory, shows the superiority of the present theory.},

abstract = {The new release AIUB-RL02 of monthly gravity models from GRACE GPS and K-Band range-rate data is based on reprocessed satellite orbits referring to the reference frame IGb08. The release is consistent with the IERS2010 conventions. Improvements with respect to its predecessor AIUB-RL01 include the use of reprocessed (RL02) GRACE observations, new atmosphere and ocean dealiasing products (RL05), an upgraded ocean tide model (EOT11A), and the interpolation of shallow ocean tides (admittances). The stochastic parametrization of AIUB-RL02 was adapted to include daily accelerometer scale factors, which drastically reduces spurious signal at the 161 d period in C20 and at other low degree and order gravity field coefficients. Moreover, the correlation between the noise in the monthly gravity models and solar activity is considerably reduced in the new release. The signal and the noise content of the new AIUB-RL02 monthly gravity fields are studied and calibrated errors are derived from their non-secular and non-seasonal variability. The short-period time-variable signal over the oceans, mostly representing noise, is reduced by 50 per cent with respect to AIUB-RL01. Compared to the official GFZ-RL05a and CSR-RL05 monthly models, the AIUB-RL02 stands out by its low noise at high degrees, a fact emerging from the estimation of seasonal variations for selected river basins and of mass trends in polar regions. Two versions of the monthly AIUB-RL02 gravity models, with spherical harmonics resolution of degree and order 60 and 90, respectively, are available for the time period from March 2003 to March 2014 at the International Center for Global Earth Models or from ftp://ftp.unibe.ch/aiub/GRAVITY/GRACE (last accessed 22 March 2016).},

abstract = {This paper examines in detail the statement in the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report that "Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations". We use a quantitative probabilistic analysis to evaluate this IPCC statement, and discuss the value of the statement in the policy context. For forcing by greenhouse gases (GHGs) only, we show that there is a greater than 90 % probability that the expected warming over 1950-2005 is larger than the total amount (not just "most") of the observed warming. This is because, following current best estimates, negative aerosol forcing has substantially offset the GHG-induced warming. We also consider the expected warming from all anthropogenic forcings using the same probabilistic framework. This requires a re-assessment of the range of possible values for aerosol forcing. We provide evidence that the IPCC estimate for the upper bound of indirect aerosol forcing is almost certainly too high. Our results show that the expected warming due to all human influences since 1950 (including aerosol effects) is very similar to the observed warming. Including the effects of natural external forcing factors has a relatively small impact on our 1950-2005 results, but improves the correspondence between model and observations over 1900-2005. Over the longer period, however, externally forced changes are insufficient to explain the early twentieth century warming. We suggest that changes in the formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Water may have been a significant contributing factor.},

abstract = {Satellite gravity gradiometry has been applied in GOCE mission to obtain higher harmonics of the Earth's gravity mapping. In-orbit results showed that the precision of GOCE gradiometry achieved a level of 10-20 mE/Hz1/2 in the bandwidth of 38-100 mHz, and the major error source came from the intrinsic noise of the core sensor electrostatic accelerometer. Two schemes for improving sensitivity of such accelerometer are presented by optimizing the parameters to reduce the dynamic range and choosing the heavier proof mass to suppress the thermal noise limited by the discharging gold wire. As a result, an accelerometer with a better resolution of 6.6×10-13 m/s 2/Hz1/2 could be developed, and then a precision of 3 mE/Hz1/2, corresponding to a spatial resolution of about 78 km half wavelength, is achievable for the future satellite gradiometric mission. {\textcopyright} 2013 COSPAR.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Institute of Geophysics of the ASCR, v.v.iA regional recovery of the Earth's gravity field from satellite observables has become particularly important in various geoscience studies in order to better localize stochastic properties of observed data, while allowing the inversion of a large amount of data, collected with a high spatial resolution only over the area of interest. One way of doing this is to use observables, which have a more localized support. As acquired in recent studies related to a regional inversion of the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) data, the satellite gravity-gradient observables have a more localized support than the gravity observations. Following this principle, we compare here the performance of the second- and third-order derivatives of the gravitational potential in context of a regional gravity modeling, namely estimating the gravity anomalies. A functional relation between these two types of observables and the gravity anomalies is formulated by means of the extended Stokes' integral formula (or more explicitly its second- and third-order derivatives) while the inverse solution is carried out by applying a least-squares technique and the ill-posed inverse problem is stabilized by applying Tikhonov's regularization. Our results reveal that the third-order radial derivatives of the gravitational potential are the most suitable among investigated input data types for a regional gravity recovery, because these observables preserve more information on a higher-frequency part of the gravitational spectrum compared to the vertical gravitational gradients. We also demonstrate that the higher-order horizontal derivatives of the gravitational potential do not necessary improve the results. We explain this by the fact that most of the gravity signal is comprised in its radial component, while the horizontal components are considerably less sensitive to spatial variations of the gravity field.},

Centimeter-accurate smartphone positioning will enable a host of new applications such as globally-registered fiduciary-marker-free augmented reality and location-based contextual advertising, both of which have been hampered by the several-meterlevel errors in traditional GNSS positioning. An empirical analysis of data collected from a smartphone-grade GNSS antenna reveals the antenna to be the primary impediment to fast and reliable resolution of the integer ambiguities which arise when solving for a centimeter-accurate carrierphase differential position. The antenna's poor multipath suppression and irregular gain pattern result in large timecorrelated phase errors which significantly increase the time to integer ambiguity resolution as compared to even a low-quality stand-alone patch antenna. The time to integer resolution—and to a centimeter-accurate fix—is significantly reduced when more GNSS signals are tracked or when the smartphone experiences gentle wavelength-scale random motion.},

As such, our work is the first-of-its-kind to model gravity at unprecedented fine scales yet with near-global coverage. The new picture of Earth's gravity encompasses a suite of gridded estimates of gravity accelerations, radial and horizontal field components, and quasi-geoid heights at over 3 billion points covering 80% of Earth's land masses. We identify new candidate locations of extreme gravity signals, suggesting that the Committee on Data for Science and Technology standard for peak-to-peak variations in free-fall gravity is too low by about 40%.

abstract = {Multi-frequency technique is expected to be widely adopted with the new generations of global navi- gation satellite system, which is anticipated to benefit ambiguity resolution (AR). Three-carrier AR (TCAR) is a classical AR method based on triple-frequency observa- tions, which is efficient for AR of short baseline. However, this method ignores the residual ionospheric delay, which degrades the reliability in active ionosphere situations and reduces the success of AR for medium and long baselines. We investigate the classical TCAR method and identify the major deficiency that hampers its application, especially to medium and long baselines. To improve this algorithm, the second and third steps of the classical TCAR are modified accordingly. In step 2, the ambiguity-resolved extra-wide- lane (EWL) combination and three pseudorange observa- tions are employed to eliminate or reduce the residual ionospheric delay, in addition to the geometry term. In step 3, besides the EWL combination and pseudoranges, the ambiguity-resolved wide-lane (WL) combination is used to completely eliminate the ionosphere and geometry terms. The combination coefficients of these pseudoranges and combinations are optimized to minimize the noise of the ambiguity estimates. In order to assess the performances, real triple-frequency observations of BeiDou navigation system of baselines with different lengths are processed by the two methods. Results show that, the classical TCAR method is very sensitive to ionospheric delay and limited to short baseline application, while the modified TCAR method is free from ionospheric delay and can be applied to AR of median and long baselines. For WL AR, the modified TCAR method shows a comparable performance with the classical TCAR method, and a better performance can be expected when the baseline becomes longer, e.g., from 100s to 1,000s kilometers. For narrow-lane AR, the modified TCAR method performs much better than the classical TCAR method for median and long baselines.},

abstract = {We apply multi-channel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) to infer the main spatiotemporal modes of mass variability in North America derived from GRACE monthly gravity field data. MSSA is a data-adaptive method for analyzing time lagged maps of variability on regional and global scales. The method proves useful in studying the annual and long- term continental water mass variations and the secular deformation signal associated with glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) of the Earth. We study the capabilities of the MSSA method using simulated spatiotemporal data series and address issues such as lag-window length, spectral mixing, and sig- nificance of the extracted modes. We investigate two cases using the GRACE RL-04 data.We analyze water mass variations derived from the GRACE data (cor- rected for GIA) and compare our results with the main modes extracted from the GLDAS/Noah and WGHM continental water storage models. Good agreement between the annual amplitudes exists in the Cordillera region, the WGHM model being closer to GRACE compared to GLDAS/Noah. Furthermore, we model the North American GIA signal using the GRACE data corrected for hydrology. Two peak signals are observed west (9–11 mm/year uplift rate) and south- east (11–13 mm/year) of Hudson Bay in agreement with the multi-dome geometry of the North American ice sheet in the ICE-5G model.

abstract = {Satellite geodetic and remote sensing techniques have been routinely used and play important roles in weather forecasting, surveying resources and monitoring/mitigating natural hazards in China. These satellites include meteorological satellites, the oceanographic satellite (HY-2) and another geodetic satellite, which are scheduled to launch in 2010. The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), in potential future collaborations with other agencies, has identified a wide range of scientific rationales and applications within China and globally which requires a long range planning of satellite geodetic and remote-sensing missions, including satellite gravity missions. One such program is China's Geo-Hazards Monitoring Program. Under the framework of this Program, the planned satellite missions include the electromagnetic satellite mission to monitor space weather, to study co-/post-seismic earthquake signals, and to explore the feasibility of the potential detectability of earthquake pre-cursor signals; as well as a near-infrared remote sensing satellite for geo-hazard imaging. A GRACE-type satellite gravity mission with enhanced accuracy and spatial resolution directly addresses some of the objectives of the Geo-Hazards Monitoring Program. The overall identified scientific rationale for a long-term plan for gravity mapping satellite missions include, but not limited to, the efficiency, accuracy and potential timeliness from such global gravity field mapping satellites, the monitoring and potential mitigations of geo- and environmental hazards, the accurate observables enabling monitoring and quantification of anthropogenic climate change, water balance budget and water resource availability, especially within China. This presentation include the articulation of scientific interest within the Chinese scientific and other community to take part or to undertake GRACE-type satellite gravity field mission, and a first-cut plan for a possible roadmap and mechanism to support the realization of a GRACE Stop-Gap mission in the appropriate time frame to minimize data loss between GRACE and GRACE follow-on missions. The plan includes the following up of the Workshop Roadmap to discuss with international partners including the US, Germany, France and others to potentially realize a GRACE Stop-Gap mission or a GRACE Stop-Gap constellation mission, on: (1) a possible offer of a couple of 10-12 m radio tracking ground support system for the GRACE Stop-Gap mission(s), (2) the possibility of launch support of the GRACE Stop-Gap satellites, and (3) the feasibility of more than one pair of enhanced GRACE-type satellites with distinct inclinations and at lower altitudes. The ongoing discussion of formal collaborative agreement between Chinese Academy of Sciences and NASA on specific cooperation on space geodetic infrastructures and satellite missions should help the possibility of a potential collaboration of GRACE Stop-Gap satellite mission. The planned GRACE laser interferometric tracking instrument development (talk by Professor Lau in this Session, Project Leader: Professor Hu, Institute of Mechanics, CAS) will be part of the long-range plan to develop satellite gravity missions.},

Specifically, LAICE will focus on the energy and momentum delivered by these waves and attempt to connect the wave sources and the wave effects in three widely different altitude ranges, substantially adding to our knowledge of critical coupling processes between disparate atmospheric regions. The LAICE mission consists of a 6U CubeSat with a four-instrument payload. The retarding potential analyzer (RPA) will provide in-situ ion density and temperature measurements. A four-channel photometer will measure density and temperature variations in the mesosphere through observations of O2 (0,0) Atmospheric band and O2 Herzberg I band airglows. There are two pressure sensors that comprise the Space Pressure Suite (SPS): the Space Neutral Pressure Instrument (SNeuPI) and the LAICE Ionization gauge Neutral Atmosphere Sensor (LINAS). Both will provide neutral density measurements, but SNeuPI is a prototype sensor that will be validated by LINAS.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the approximate reconstruction of the earth's potential field from geometric and gravimetric data. This is an ill-posed problem involving typically large amounts of data which are to be continued by a harmonic function. The standard approach in geodesy is based on spherical harmonics which are globally supported. Thus, a least squares approach for the data fitting yields a linear system of equations with a fully populated system matrix. This becomes computationally prohibitive for large amounts of data and, therefore, presents the biggest bottleneck for fast and efficient computations. Motivated by the early work [24], we propose in this paper an alternative and pose the harmonicity requirement on the continuation together with the data fitting as a minimization problem for a least squares functional with regularization involving the Laplacian. This approach enables the use of locally supported functions in the reconstruction for which we employ tensor products of cubic splines. The linear system resulting from the weighted least squares approach is therefore sparsely populated which allows for iterative solvers of complexity proportional to the total number of unknowns. We extensively study the choice of the regularization parameter balancing the data fit and the harmonicity requirement for both synthetic as well as earth potential data. We compare the results with discretizations using finite differences and finite elements for solving Laplace's equation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many characteristics of the ocean circulation are reflected in the mean dynamic topography (MDT). Therefore observing the MDT provides valuable information for evaluating or improving ocean models. Using this information is complicated by the inconsistent representation of MDT in observations and ocean models. This problem is addressed by a consistent treatment of satellite altimetry and geoid height information on an ocean model grid. The altimetric sea surface is expressed as a sum of geoid heights represented by spherical harmonic functions and the mean dynamic topography parameterized by a finite element method. Within this framework the inversion and smoothing processes are avoided that are necessary in step-by-step approaches, such that the normal equations of the MDT can be accumulated in a straightforward way. Conveniently, these normal equations are the appropriate weight matrices for model-data misfits in least-squares ocean model inversions. Two prototypes of these rigorously combined MDT models, with an associated complete error description including the omission error, are developed for the North Atlantic Ocean and assimilated into a 3D-inverse ocean model. The ocean model solutions provide evidence that satellite observations and oceanographic data are consistent within prior errors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ocean tides redistribute mass at high temporal frequencies. Satellite missions that aim to observe medium to low frequency mass variations need to take into account this rapidly varying mass signal. Correcting for the effects of ocean tides by means of imperfect models might hamper the observation of other temporal gravity field signals of interest. This paper explores different methods for mitigating aliasing errors for the specific example of observing mass variations due to land hydrology, including temporal filtering of time-series of gravity solutions, spatial smoothing and the use of satellite constellations. For this purpose, an Earth System Model (ESM) was constructed, which included state-of-the-art time varying components for ocean, atmosphere, solid Earth, hydrology, ice-sheets and ocean tides. Using the ESM, we simulated the retrieval of the hydrologically driven gravity field changes using a number of different satellite constellations. We find that (1) the ocean tide aliasing strongly depends on the satellite constellation, the choice of orbital parameters and the length of the data span; (2) the aliasing effect manifests itself differently for different geographical regions; (3) the aliasing causes a peculiar striping pattern along the ground track of the satellite orbits; (4) optimizing the choice of orbital parameters of a single GRACE-type tandem can be more effective at reducing the aliasing of ocean tide model errors than flying more tandems. Finally, we corroborate the experiences with GRACE data analysis that appropriate post-processing techniques can significantly improve the quality of the retrieved gravity changes.},

@book{Cosmo1997,
abstract = {A new edition of the Tethers in Space Handbook was needed after the last edition published in 1989. Tether-related activities have been quite busy in the 90's. We have had the flights of TSSI and TSSI-R, SEDS-1 and -2, PMG, TIPS and OEDIPUS. In less than three years there have been one international Conference on Tethers in Space, held in Washington DC, and three workshops, held at ESA/Estec in the Netherlands, at ISAS in Japan and at the University of Michigan, Ann Harbor. The community has grown and we finally have real flight data to compare our models with. The life of spaceborne tethers has not been always easy and we got our dose of setbacks, but we feel pretty optimistic for the future. We are just stepping out of the pioneering stage to start to use tethers for space science and technological applications. As we are writing this handbook TiPs, a NRL tether project is flying above our heads. There is no emphasis in affirming that as of today spacebome tethers are a reality and their potential is far from being fully appreciated. Consequently, a large amount of new information had to be incorporated into this new edition. The general structure of the handbook has been left mostly unchanged. The past editors have set a style which we have not felt needed change. The section on the flights has been enriched with information on the scientific results. The categories of the applications have not been modified, and in some cases we have mentioned the existence of related flight data. We felt that the section contributed by Joe Carroll, called Tether Data, should be maintained as it was, being a "classic" and still very accurate and not at all obsolete. We have introduced a new chapter entitled Space Science and Tethers since flight experience has shown that tethers can complement other space-based investigations. The bibliography has been updated. Due to the great production in the last few years %e had to restrict our search to works published in refereed journal. The production, however, is much more extensive. In addition, we have included the summary of the papers presented at the last International Conference which was a forum for first-hand information on all the flights.},

abstract = {The paper deals with an analytical study of various corrected Newtonian potentials. We offer a complete description of the corrected potentials, for the entire range of the parameters involved. These parameters can be fixed for different models in order to obtain a good concordance with known data. Some of the potentials are generated by continued fractions, and another one is derived from the Newtonian potential by adding a logarithmic correction. The zonal potential, which models the motion of a satellite moving in the equatorial plane of the Earth, is also considered. The range of the parameters for which the potentials behave or not similarly to the Newtonian one is pointed out. The shape of the potentials is displayed for all the significant cases, as well as the orbit of Raduga-1M 2 satellite in the field generated by the continued fractional potential U3, and then by the zonal one. For the continued fractional potential U2 we study the basic problem of the existence and linear stability of circular orbits. We prove that such orbits exist and are linearly stable. This qualitative study offers the possibility to choose the adequate potential, either for modeling the motion of planets or satellites, or to explain some phenomena at galactic scale.},

abstract = {The Mercury Surface, Space Environment, GEochemestry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft, launched on August 3, 2004, was inserted in a highly elliptical polar orbit around the planet on March 18, 2011. One of the main mission goals is the determination of the interior structure of the planet, enabled by a suite of instruments that includes the radio system and a laser altimeter. Thanks to altimetric and radio observables, the topography and the gravity field of the planet have been retrieved with good accuracy, especially in the north polar region, where the spacecraft altitude is lower. In September, 2011, the radio tracking data of the first 6 months of operations were published with the ancillary information necessary for the MESSENGER orbit determination. This data set offers an excellent opportunity to test the orbit determination procedures developed in view of a similar, but more accurate, experiment hosted onboard BepiColombo, the ESA mission to Mercury. We present here the results of our analysis, which provide the spacecraft orbit, a 20??20 gravity field and a linear update of Mercury's ephemeris. The estimated gravity field is fully compatible with the one published by Smith et al. (2012). ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

(Journal of Geophysical Research, 115, C09025, doi:10.1029/2010JC006113, 2010), in paragraph 47 we adopted a value of 0.52 mm/yr for the estimated rate of present-day sea level change in the Falkland Islands due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). This value was used to remove the contributions of GIA to our measurements of historical and recent rates of sea level change. However, it was based on a misreading of the data file of Peltier 2004 on the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level Web site More reasonable values to apply to the observed changes since the mid-nineteenth century and in recent years would be 0.69 and 0.61 mm/yr respectively. Consequently, the long-term rate of sea level change between 1842 and the early 1980s, after correction for air pressure effects and for GIA, reported as +0.75 0.35 mm/yr in paragraphs 1, 47, 55, and 61 should be +0.92 0.35 mm/yr, the corresponding rate between 1842 and the midpoint of recent data of 1.06 0.22 mm/yr in paragraphs 48 and 55 should be 1.23 0.22 mm/yr, and the corresponding rate since 1992 reported as 2.51 0.58 mm/yr in paragraphs 1 and 52 becomes 2.60 0.58 mm/yr. The middle of paragraph 63 becomes The Stanley data suggest that the rate of change of sea level in East Falkland since 1992 has been approximately 2.6 mm/yr, a rate supported by information from satellite altimetry. These small GIA model corrections have no bearing on the main findings of our paper on the difference in the rates of sea level change between the historical (1842 to present-day) and recent (last 2 decades) epochs},

@article{Celletti2015b,
abstract = {? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.We study the dynamics of the space debris in regions corresponding to minor resonances; precisely, we consider the resonances 3:1, 3:2, 4:1, 4:3, 5:1, 5:2, 5:3, 5:4, where a j:? resonance (with j, ??Z) means that the periods of revolution of the debris and of rotation of the Earth are in the ratio j/?. We consider a Hamiltonian function describing the effect of the geopotential and we use suitable finite expansions of the Hamiltonian for the description of the different resonances. In particular, we determine the leading terms which dominate in a specific orbital region, thus limiting our computation to very few harmonics. Taking advantage from the pendulum-like structure associated to each term of the expansion, we are able to determine the amplitude of the islands corresponding to the different harmonics. By means of simple mathematical formulae, we can predict the occurrence of splitting or overlapping of the resonant islands for different values of the parameters. We also find several cases which exhibit a transcritical bifurcation as the inclination is varied. These results, which are based on a careful mathematical analysis of the Hamiltonian expansion, are confirmed by a numerical study of the dynamical behavior obtained by computing the so-called fast Laypunov indicators. Since the Hamiltonian approach includes just the effect of the geopotential, we validate our results by performing a numerical integration in Cartesian variables of a more complete model including the gravitational attraction of Sun and Moon, as well as the solar radiation pressure.},

@article{Kusche2009,
abstract = {We have analyzed recent gravity recovery and cli-mate experiment (GRACE) RL04 monthly gravity solutions, using a new decorrelating post-processing approach. We find very good agreement with mass anomalies derived from a global hydrological model. The post-processed GRACE solu-tions exhibit only little amplitude damping and an almost negligible phase shift and period distortion for relevant hydrological basins. Furthermore, these post-processed GRACE solutions have been inspected in terms of data fit with respect to the original inter-satellite ranging and to SLR and GPS observations. This kind of comparison is new. We find variations of the data fit due to solution post-processing only within very narrow limits. This confirms our suspicion that GRACE data do not firmly 'pinpoint' the standard uncon-strained solutions. Regarding the original Kusche (J Geod 81:733–749, 2007) decorrelation and smoothing method, a simplified (order-convolution) approach has been developed. This simplified approach allows to realize a higher resolu-tion—as necessary, e.g., for generating computed GRACE observations—and needs far less coefficients to be stored.},

@article{Mitchell2000a,
abstract = {To the extent that model error is nonnegligible in numerical models of the atmosphere, it must be accounted for in 4D atmospheric data assimilation systems. In this study. a method of estimating and accounting for model error in the context of an ensemble Kalman filter technique is developed. The method involves parameterizing the model error and using innovations to estimate the model-error parameters. The estimation algorithm is based on a maximum likelihood approach and the study is performed in an idealized environment using 3 three-level, quasigeostrophic, T21 model and simulated observations and model error. The use of a limited number of ensemble members gives rise to a rank problem in the estimate of the covariance matrix of the innovations. The effect of this problem on the two terms of the log-likelihood function is that the variance term is underestimated, while the chi(2) term is overestimated. To permit the use of relatively small ensembles. a number of strategies are developed to deal with these systematic estimation problems. These include the imposition of a block structure on the covariance matrix of the innovations and a Richardson extrapolation of the log-likelihood value to infinite ensemble size. It is shown that with the use of these techniques. estimates of the model-error parameters are quite acceptable in a statistical sense, even though estimates based on any single innovation vector can be poor. It is found that, with temporal smoothing of the model-error parameter estimates, the adaptive ensemble Kalman filter produces fairly good estimates of the parameters and accounts rather well for the model error In fact, its performance in a data assimilation cycle is almost as good as that of a cycle in which the correct model-error or parameters are used to increase the spread in the ensemble.},

@article{Sneeuw2014a,
abstract = {? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.Given the continuous decline in global runoff data availability over the past decades, alternative approaches for runoff determination are gaining importance. When aiming for global scale runoff at a sufficient temporal resolution and with homogeneous accuracy, the choice to use spaceborne sensors is only a logical step. In this respect, we take water storage changes from Gravity Recovery And Climate Explorer (grace) results and water level measurements from satellite altimetry, and present a comprehensive assessment of five different approaches for river runoff estimation: Hydrological balance equation, hydro-meteorological balance equation, satellite altimetry with quantile function-based stage?discharge relationships, a rudimentary instantaneous runoff?precipitation relationship, and a runoff?storage relationship that takes time lag into account. As a common property, these approaches do not rely on hydrological modeling; they are either purely data driven or make additional use of atmospheric reanalyses. Further, these methods, except runoff?precipitation ratio, use geodetic observables as one of their inputs and, therefore, they are termed hydro-geodetic approaches. The runoff prediction skill of these approaches is validated against in situ runoff and compared to hydrological model predictions. Our results show that catchment-specific methods (altimetry and runoff?storage relationship) clearly outperform the global methods (hydrological and hydro-meteorological approaches) in the six study regions we considered. The global methods have the potential to provide runoff over all landmasses, which implies gauged and ungauged basins alike, but are still limited due to inconsistencies in the global hydrological and hydro-meteorological datasets that they use.},

When compared to Earth Gravitational Model 2008, it is more accurate at low to medium resolution, thanks to GOCE and GRACE data. When compared to earlier releases of European Space Agency GOCE models, it is more accurate at high degrees owing to the larger amount of data ingested, which was moreover taken at lower altitude. The impact of orbiting at lower altitude in the last year of the mission is large: a model based on data of the last 14 months is significantly more accurate than the release 4 model constructed with the first 28 months. The (calibrated) cumulated geoid error estimate at 100 km resolution is 1.7 cm. The optimal resolution of the GOCE model for oceanographic application is between 100 and 125 km.

abstract = {There is trend in spacecraft engineering toward distributed systems where a number of smaller spacecraft work as a larger satellite. However, in order to make the small satellites work together as a single large platform, the precise relative positions (baseline) and orientations (attitude) of the elements of the formation have to be estimated. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS, the general term for systems as GPS and Galileo) receivers can be utilized to provide baseline estimates with centimeter to millimeter level accuracy. These precise GNSS applications utilize the carrier phase observations, which are inherently ambiguous. While precise relative positioning using GNSS for surveying has been around for some time, precise relative navigation for moving applications on land, on water, in the air and even in space is still under development. The methods developed in this thesis can be applied for all these applications as no model for the user dynamics is applied (the methods are independent of the user motion).},

abstract = {ESA's SWARM constellation of three near-polar satellites was launched on 22 November 2013, with the primary scientific objective to map the Earth's magnetic field and its variations. Although not among its primary scientific objectives, the specific orbital formation geometry of the three identical SWARM accelerometer-equipped satellites allows recovery for more accurate low-degree temporal gravity field. Equipped with satellite laser ranging retro-reflectors, accelerometers and geodetic-quality GPS receivers, data from the SWARM satellites have been used to estimate low-degree temporal gravity field based on the acceleration, short-arc, and celestial mechanics approaches, with geopotential solutions complete to degree and order 15. Here we will use the improved formulation for the energy balance approach (EBA) to estimate the temporal gravity field using data from the SWARM satellites. The improved energy balance approach to generate in situ geopotential difference measurements using the GRACE KBR data has achieved the measurement accuracy by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to previous studies. Specifically, we will: (1) assess the accuracy of SWARM temporal gravity field EBA solutions by comparing with solutions using other approaches and versus GRACE solutions using GPS and using KBR; (2) assess the impact on low- degree temporal gravity field EBA solutions using kinematic or dynamic SWARM GPS orbits; (3) evaluate low-degree temporal gravity solutions with or without accelerometer-corrections for data from individual SWARM satellite or from the combined constellation of SWARM satellites; (4) evaluate and confirm the maximum achievable degree and order of temporal gravity field model using data from the SWARM constellation of satellites, and (5) investigate the fidelity of the estimated SWARM second degree zonal geopotential coefficients and other approaches, as well as the solutions using other data, including SLR, other GPS, and GRACE KBR solutions.},

Using data from the CHAMP science mission, the in-flight performance of the BlackJack receiver has been assessed and the impact of various software updates performed during the 2.5 years since launch is described. Key aspects of the study comprise the channel allocation, anomalous data points, and the noise level of the code and carrier data. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the code measurements collected onboard the CHAMP satellite are notably affected by multipath errors in the aft-looking hemisphere, which can be attributed to cross-talk between the occultation antenna string and the primary precise orbit determination antenna. For carrier smoothed 10 s normal points, the code noise itself varies between a minimum of 5 cm at high elevations and 0.5 m (C/A) to 1.0 m (P 1, P 2) at 10° elevation. Carrier-phase data exhibit representative errors of 0.2 to 2.5 mm. The results of the CHAMP GPS data analysis contribute to a better understanding and possible improvement of the BlackJack receiver and support the design of optimal data editing and weighting strategies in precise orbit determination applications.},

To use these gravity gradients for application\nin Earth scienes and gravity field analysis, additional preprocessing\nneeds to be done, including corrections for temporal gravity field\nsignals to isolate the static gravity field part, screening for outliers,\ncalibration by comparison with existing external gravity field information\nand error assessment. The temporal gravity gradient corrections consist\nof tidal and nontidal corrections. These are all generally below\nthe gravity gradient error level, which is predicted to show a 1/f\nbehaviour for low frequencies. In the outlier detection, the 1/f\nerror is compensated for by subtracting a local median from the data,\nwhile the data error is assessed using the median absolute deviation.\nThe local median acts as a high-pass filter and it is robust as is\nthe median absolute deviation. Three different methods have been\nimplemented for the calibration of the gravity gradients. All three\nmethods use a high-pass filter to compensate for the 1/f gravity\ngradient error. The baseline method uses state-of-the-art global\ngravity field models and the most accurate results are obtained if\nstar sensor misalignments are estimated along with the calibration\nparameters. A second calibration method uses GOCE GPS data to estimate\na low-degree gravity field model as well as gravity gradient scale\nfactors. Both methods allow to estimate gravity gradient scale factors\ndown to the 10-3 level. The third calibration method uses high accurate\nterrestrial gravity data in selected regions to validate the gravity\ngradient scale factors, focussing on the measurement band.

abstract = {In view of the pivotal role that continental water storage plays in the Earth's water, energy and biogeochemical cycles, the temporal and spatial variations of water storage for large areas are presently not known with satisfactory accuracy. Estimates of the seasonal storage change vary between less than 50 mm water equivalent in areas with uniform climatic conditions to 450 mm water equivalent in tropical river basins with a strong seasonality of the climate. Due to the lack of adequate ground-based measurements of water storage changes, the evapotranspiration rate, which depends on the actual climatic and environmental conditions, is only an approximation for large areas until now, or it is based on the assumption that storage changes level out for long time periods. Furthermore, the partitioning of the water storage changes among different storage components is insufficiently known for large scales. The direct measurement of water storage changes for large areas by satellite-based gravity field measurements is thus of uttermost importance in the field of hydrology in order to close the water balance at different scales in space and time, and to validate and improve the predictive capacity of large-scale hydrological models. Due to the high spatial variability of hydrological processes temporal and spatial resolutions beyond that of GRACE are essential for a spatial differentiation in evapotranspiration and water storage partitioning.},

abstract = {Processing of data from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), such as GPS, GLONASS and Galileo, can be considerably impeded by disturbances in the ionosphere. Cycle-slip detection and correction thus becomes a crucial component of robust software. Still, dealing with ionospheric cycle slips is not trivial due to scintillation effects in both the phase and the amplitude of the signals. In this contribution, a geometry-based approach with rigorous handling of the ionosphere is presented. A detailed analysis of the cycle-slip correction process is also tackled by examining its dependence on phase and code noise, non-dispersive effects and, of course, the ionosphere. The importance of stochastic modeling in validating the integer cycle-slip candidates is emphasized and illustrated through simulations. By examining the relationship between ionospheric bias and ionospheric constraint, it is shown that there is a limit in the magnitude of ionospheric delay variation that can be handled by the cycle-slip correction process. Those concepts are applied to GNSS data collected by stations in northern Canada, and show that enhanced cycle-slip detection can lead to decimeter-level improvements in the accuracy of kinematic PPP solutions with a 30-s sampling interval. Cycle-slip correction associated with ionospheric delay variations exceeding 50 cm is also demonstrated, although there are risks with such a procedure and these are pointed out. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Klees2008,
abstract = {SUMMARY Most applications of the publicly released Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment monthly gravity field models require the application of a spatial filter to help suppressing noise and other systematic errors present in the data. The most common approach makes use of a simple Gaussian averaging process, which is often combined with a ‘destriping' technique in which coefficient correlations within a given degree are removed. As brute force methods, neither of these techniques takes into consideration the statistical information from the gravity solution itself and, while they perform well overall, they can often end up removing more signal than necessary. Other optimal filters have been proposed in the literature; however, none have attempted to make full use of all information available from the monthly solutions. By examining the underlying principles of filter design, a filter has been developed that incorporates the noise and full signal variance–covariance matrix to tailor the filter to the error characteristics of a particular monthly solution. The filter is both anisotropic and non-symmetric, meaning it can accommodate noise of an arbitrary shape, such as the characteristic stripes. The filter minimizes the mean-square error and, in this sense, can be considered as the most optimal filter possible. Through both simulated and real data scenarios, this improved filter will be shown to preserve the highest amount of gravity signal when compared to other standard techniques, while simultaneously minimizing leakage effects and producing smooth solutions in areas of low signal.},

Proximity and speed relative to GEO during near-miss events detected under a torus intersection metric are translated into a combined risk factor that is accumulated during propagation. This accumulated risk is then used to identify the objects that have the highest risk contributions, either globally or in the vicinity of one of the two gravitational wells at 75°E and 105°W. Results show that nearly 60% of the total risk surrounding the Western well is attributed to 10 derelicts alone, which has critical implications for active debris removal (ADR) target selection for attenuating risk levels in this ring.},

abstract = {Using the new generation Earth's gravity field models EIGEN-2S, GGM01S and EIGEN-GRACE02S generated by the space missions CHAMP and GRACE, we have obtained an accurate measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect with the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites analyzing about 10 years of data with the EIGEN-2S and GGM01S models and about 11 years of data with EIGEN-GRACE02S. This new analysis is in agreement with our previous measurements of the Lense-Thirring effect using the LAGEOS satellites and obtained with the JGM-3 and EGM96 Earth's models. However, the new determinations are more accurate and, especially, more robust than our previous measurements. In the present analysis we are only using the nodal rates of the two satellites, making no use of the perigee rate, as in our previous analyses. The perigee is affected by a number of non-gravitational perturbations difficult to be modelled and whose impact in the total error budget is not easy to assess. Using the EIGEN-2S model, we obtain a total error budget between 18% and 36% of the Lense-Thirring effect due to all the error sources. Specifically, by using EIGEN-2S, we obtain: $\mu$ = 0.85, with a total error between ±0.18 and ±0.36, with GGM01S we get $\mu$ = 1.06 with a total error between ±0.19 and ±0.24 and with EIGEN-GRACE02S we obtain $\mu$ = 0.99, with a total error between ±0.05 and ±0.1, i.e., between 5% and 10% of the general relativistic predicted value of the Lense-Thirring effect. In addition to the analyses using EIGEN-2S, GGM01S and EIGEN-GRACE02S without the use of the perigee, we have also performed an analysis using the older model EGM96 with our previous method of combining the nodes of the LAGEOS satellites with the perigee of LAGEOS II. However, this analysis was performed over a period of about 10 years, i.e. about 2.5 times longer than any our previous analysis. The result using EGM96 over this longer period of observation agrees with our previous results over much shorter periods and with the EIGEN-2S, GGM01S and EIGEN-GRACE02S measurements of $\mu$. In addition to the accurate determination of frame-dragging and in agreement with our previous analyses of the orbits of the LAGEOS satellites, we have observed, since 1998, an anomalous change in the Earth quadrupole coefficient, J2 which agrees with recent findings of other authors. This anomalous variation of J2 is accurately observed both on the node of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II and it is independent of the model used, i.e., it is observed by using the model EGM96 or by using EIGEN-2S, GGM01S or EIGEN-GRACE02S. However, this anomalous variation of the Earth quadrupole coefficient does not affect at all our determination of the Lense-Thirring effect thanks to the total elimination of the J2-induced errors with our especially devised estimation technique. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Rummel2011,
abstract = {GOCE is the first gravitational gradiometry satellite mission. Gravitational gradiometry is the measurement of the second derivatives of the gravitational potential. The nine derivatives form a 3 × 3 matrix, which in geodesy is referred to as Marussi tensor. From the basic properties of the gravitational field, it follows that the matrix is symmetric and trace free. The latter property corresponds to Laplace equation, which gives the theoretical foundation of its representation in terms of spherical harmonic or Fourier series. At the same time, it provides the most powerful quality check of the actual measured gradients. GOCE gradiometry is based on the principle of differential accelerometry. As the satellite carries out a rotational motion in space, the accelerometer differences contain angular effects that must be removed. The GOCE gradiometer provides the components V xx , V yy , V zz and V xz with high precision, while the components V xy and V yz are of low precision, all expressed in the gradiometer reference frame. The best performance is achieved inside the measurement band from 5 × 10–3 to 0.1 Hz. At lower frequencies, the noise increases with 1/f and is superimposed by cyclic distortions, which are modulated from the orbit and attitude motion into the gradient measurements. Global maps with the individual components show typical patterns related to topographic and tectonic features. The maps are separated into those for ascending and those for descending tracks as the components are expressed in the instrument frame. All results are derived from the measurements of the period from November to December 2009. While the components V xx and V yy reach a noise level of about $${10\\;\\rm{\\frac{mE}{\\sqrt{Hz}}}}$$, that of V zz and V xz is about $${20\\; \\rm{\\frac{mE}{\\sqrt{Hz}}}}$$. The cause of the latter's higher noise is not yet understood. This is also the reason why the deviation from the Laplace condition is at the $${20 \\;\\rm{\\frac{mE}{\\sqrt{Hz}}}}$$ level instead of the originally planned $${11\\;\\rm{\\frac{mE}{\\sqrt{Hz}}}}$$. Each additional measurement cycle will improve the accuracy and to a smaller extent also the resolution of the spherical harmonic coefficients derived from the measured gradients.},

We analyze the IGS submission and four\nof the individual AC contributions in terms of the GNSS frame origin\nand scale, station position repeatability and time series seasonal\nvariations. We show here that the GPS Terrestrial Reference Frame\n(TRF) origin is consistent with Satellite laser Ranging (SLR) at\nthe centimeter level with a drift lower than 1 mm/year. Although\nthe scale drift compared to Very Long baseline Interferometry (VLBI)\nand SLR mean scale is smaller than 0.4 mm/year, we think that it\nwould be premature to use that information in the ITRF scale definition\ndue to its strong dependence on the GPS satellite and ground antenna\nphase center variations. The new position time series also show a\nbetter repeatability compared to past IGS combined products and their\nannual variations are shown to be more consistent with loading models.\nThe comparison of GPS station positions and velocities to those of\nVLBI via local ties in co-located sites demonstrates that the IGS\nreprocessed solution submitted to the ITRF2008 is more reliable and\nprecise than any of the past submissions. However, we show that some\nof the remaining inconsistencies between GPS and VLBI positioning\nmay be caused by uncalibrated GNSS radomes.},

abstract = {Satellite gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provide quantitative measurement of terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes with unprecedented accuracy. Combining GRACE-observed TWS changes and independent estimates of water change in soil and snow and surface reservoirs offers a means for estimating groundwater storage change. Since its launch in March 2002, GRACE time-variable gravity data have been successfully used to quantify long-term groundwater storage changes in different regions over the world, including northwest India, the High Plains Aquifer and the Central Valley in the USA, the North China Plain, Middle East, and southern Murray–Darling Basin in Australia, where groundwater storage has been significantly depleted in recent years (or decades). It is difficult to rely on in situ groundwater measurements for accurate quantification of large, regional-scale groundwater storage changes, especially at long timescales due to inadequate spatial and temporal coverage of in situ data and uncertainties in storage coefficients. The now nearly 13 years of GRACE gravity data provide a successful and unique complementary tool for monitoring and measuring groundwater changes on a global and regional basis. Despite the successful applications of GRACE in studying global groundwater storage change, there are still some major challenges limiting the application and interpretation of GRACE data. In this paper, we present an overview of GRACE applications in groundwater studies and discuss if and how the main challenges to using GRACE data can be addressed.},

abstract = {GOCO05c is a gravity field model computed as a combined solution of a satellite-only model and a global data set of gravity anomalies. It is resolved up to degree and order 720. It is the first model applying regionally varying weighting. Since this causes strong correlations among all gravity field parameters, the resulting full normal equation system with a size of 2 TB had to be solved rigorously by applying high-performance computing. GOCO05c is the first combined gravity field model independent of EGM2008 that contains GOCE data of the whole mission period. The performance of GOCO05c is externally validated by GNSS–levelling comparisons, orbit tests, and computation of the mean dynamic topography, achieving at least the quality of existing high-resolution models. Results show that the additional GOCE information is highly beneficial in insufficiently observed areas, and that due to the weighting scheme of individual data the spectral and spatial consistency of the model is significantly improved. Due to usage of fill-in data in specific regions, the model cannot be used for physical interpretations in these regions.},

With the modernisation of GNSS, multi-constellation and multi-frequency data processing is one of the foci of current GNSS research. The GNSS development authorities have better designs for the new signals, which are aimed for fast acquisition for civil users, less susceptible to interference and multipath, and having lower measurement noise. However, how good are the new signals in practice? The aim of this paper is to provide an early assessment of the newly available signals as well as assessment of the other currently available signals. The signal quality of the multi-GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BDS and QZSS) is assessed by looking at their zero-baseline Double Difference (DD) CP residuals. The impacts of multi-GNSS multi-frequency signals on single-epoch positioning are investigated in terms of accuracy, precision and fixed solution availability with known short baselines.</p>},

abstract = {We propose here two new transformations between inertial frames that apply for relative velocities greater than the speed of light, and that are complementary to the Lorentz transformation, giving rise to the Einstein special theory of relativity that applies to relative velocities less than the speed of light. The new transformations arise from the same mathematical framework as the Lorentz transformation, displaying singular behaviour when the relative velocity approaches the speed of light and generating the same addition law for velocities, but, most importantly, do not involve the need to introduce imaginary masses or complicated physics to provide well-defined expressions. Making use of the dependence on relative velocity of the Lorentz transformation, the paper provides an elementary derivation of the new transformations between inertial frames for relative velocities v in excess of the speed of light c, and further we suggest two possible criteria from which one might infer one set of transformations as physically more likely than the other. If the energy-momentum equations are to be invariant under the new transformations, then the mass and energy are given, respectively, by the formulae [IMG]/medium/RSPA20120340IM1.gif" ALT="Formula "> and [IMG]/medium/RSPA20120340IM2.gif" ALT="Formula "> where [IMG]/medium/RSPA20120340IM3.gif" ALT="Formula "> denotes the limiting momentum for infinite relative velocity. If, however, the requirement of invariance is removed, then we may propose new mass and energy equations, and an example having finite non-zero mass in the limit of infinite relative velocity is given. In this highly controversial topic, our particular purpose is not to enter into the merits of existing theories, but rather to present a succinct and carefully reasoned account of a new aspect of Einstein's theory of special relativity, which properly allows for faster than light motion.},

abstract = {Historical development of related time and solar coordinate definitions. Several approaches to determine solar time and angle, with solar altitude and azimuth angle. Equations for solar altitude and azimuth are recommended for calculation purposes. Unification of solar position calculations based on preferred orientation and time is proposed. Accurate calculations and recording of time either in local clock time or true solar time in regular daytime measurements of sun and sky radiation and light, in computer programs evaluating solar irradiance or sunlight and skylight illuminance currently apply differently defined solar hour angles as well as angularly determined solar altitude and azimuth coordinates. The historical basis of solar geometry used to construct sundials for the measurements of true solar time were gradually replaced during Middle Ages by spherical trigonometry relations of solar altitude and azimuth angles including solar declination, local geographical latitude and time changes in better precision. However, in different scientific and practical applications like in solar energy or daylight calculations are currently used several systems and formulae defining sun position and time which need to be unified and standardised in computer programs or measurement evaluations. Potential confusion and inconsistent results should be avoided, possible mistakes have to be checked and corrected after the valid ISO international standard. This paper discusses various approaches considering time and sun coordinates in different systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

(Geophys Res Lett 34: L13302, 2007), for reducing the correlated errors in the Stokes coefficients (SCs) of the spherical harmonic expansion of the GRACE determined monthly geopotential solutions. Based on a comparison of the three published approaches mentioned, we propose a refined approach for choosing parameters of the decorrelation filter. Our approach is based on the error pattern of the SCs in the monthly GRACE geopotential solutions. We keep a portion of the lower degree-order SCs with the smallest errors unchanged, and high-pass filter the rest using a moving window technique, with window width decreasing as the error of the SCs increases. Both the unchanged portion of SCs and the window width conform with the error pattern, and are adjustable with a parameter. Compared to the three published approaches mentioned, our unchanged portion of SCs and window width depend on both degree and order in a more complex way. We have used the trend of mass change to test various parameters toward a preferred choice for a global compromise between the removal of the correlated errors and the minimization of signal distortion.},

abstract = {Rapid fluctuations in the amplitude and phase of a transionospheric radio signal caused by small scale plasma density irregularities in the ionosphere are known as scintillation. Scintillation can seriously impair a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) receiver tracking performance, thus affecting the required levels of availability, accuracy and integrity, and consequently the reliability of modern day GNSS based applications. This paper presents an analysis of correlation between scintillation levels and tracking performance of a GNSS receiver for GPS L1C/A, L2C and GLONASS L1, L2 signals. The analyses make use of data recorded over Presidente Prudente (22.1S, 51.4W, dip latitude∼12.3S) in Brazil, a location close to the Equatorial Ionisation Anomaly (EIA) crest in Latin America. The study presents for the first time this type of correlation analysis for GPS L2C and GLONASS L1, L2 signals. The scintillation levels are defined by the amplitude scintillation index, S 4 and the receiver tracking performance is evaluated by the phase tracking jitter. Both S 4 and the phase tracking jitter are estimated from the post correlation In-Phase (I) and Quadra-Phase (Q) components logged by the receiver at a high rate. Results reveal that the dependence of the phase tracking jitter on the scintillation levels can be represented by a quadratic fit for the signals. The results presented in this paper are of importance to GNSS users, especially in view of the forthcoming high phase of solar cycle 24 (predicted for 2013). {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {The Tianshan mountain range is experiencing a notable environmental change as a result of global warming. In this paper; we adopt multiple remote sensing techniques to examine the diversified geophysical changes in the Tianshan; including glacier changes measured by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat); lake level changes measured by radar altimetry; and snow coverage measured by moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). We find a rapid transition from dry years to wet years in 2010 in the western and northern Tianshan for all the geophysical measurements. The transition is likely caused by increasing westerlies and greatly pollutes the gravity signals in the edge of Tianshan. However, glaciers in the central Tianshan are unaffected and have been steadily losing mass at a rate of �4.0 0.7 Gt/year during 2003�2014 according to space gravimetry and �3.4 0.8 Gt/year during 2003�2009 according to laser altimetry. Our results show a weaker declining trend and greater linearity compared with earlier estimates; because we investigate the signal pattern in more detail. Finally; water level records of 60 years in Bosten Lake; China; are presented to show that for areas strongly dependent on meltwater; rising temperature can benefit the water supply in the short run; but cause it to deteriorate in the long run.},

abstract = {We present measurements of thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures measured by two Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs) operating in northeastern Brazil, in the equatorial region, over the period of September 2009 through June 2012. The FPIs observe the Doppler shift and broadening of the nighttime 630.0-nm emission originating at altitudes of approximately 240km. The temperatures indicate a strong dependence on solar flux conditions, as captured by the F10.7 index, which ranged from $\sim$72 to 175 solar flux units over the duration of the study. The signature of the midnight temperature maximum is seen in the data, recurring each year during the local summer months (October through February). Throughout the year, the thermospheric zonal winds show an initial increase in eastward flow after sunset followed by a reduction in the midnight and early morning hours. This reduction in the zonal flow is most rapid in the local summer months. The thermospheric meridional winds show the expected signature of trans-equatorial flow from the summer to winter hemisphere. Superposed on this during the local summer months is a time of equatorward flow during the mid-evening period, 22-23LT, which is likely a manifestation of the semi-diurnal thermal tidal wave moving upward into the lower thermosphere region from below. The thermospheric neutral winds do not show as much of a dependence on the solar flux as the thermospheric neutral temperatures do, at least for the range of fluxes covered during the study period. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Bruni2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany The realization of the international terrestrial reference frame (ITRF) is currently based on the data provided by four space geodetic techniques. The accuracy of the different technique-dependent materializations of the frame physical parameters (origin and scale) varies according to the nature of the relevant observables and to the impact of technique-specific errors. A reliable computation of the ITRF requires combining the different inputs, so that the strengths of each technique can compensate for the weaknesses of the others. This combination, however, can only be performed providing some additional information which allows tying together the independent technique networks. At present, the links used for that purpose are topometric surveys (local/terrestrial ties) available at ITRF sites hosting instruments of different techniques. In principle, a possible alternative could be offered by spacecrafts accommodating the positioning payloads of multiple geodetic techniques realizing their co-location in orbit (space ties). In this paper, the GNSS–SLR space ties on-board GPS and GLONASS satellites are thoroughly examined in the framework of global reference frame computations. The investigation focuses on the quality of the realized physical frame parameters. According to the achieved results, the space ties on-board GNSS satellites cannot, at present, substitute terrestrial ties in the computation of the ITRF. The study is completed by a series of synthetic simulations investigating the impact that substantial improvements in the volume and quality of SLR observations to GNSS satellites would have on the precision of the GNSS frame parameters.},

This paper reviews the important results from these studies and also presents new ideas and alternative interpretations which further explain the success of the EnKF. In addition to providing the theoretical framework needed for using the EnKF, there is also a focus on the algorithmic formulation and optimal numerical implementation. A program listing is given for some of the key subroutines. The paper also touches upon specific issues such as the use of nonlinear measurements, in situ profiles of temperature and salinity, and data which are available with high frequency in time. An ensemble based optimal interpolation (EnOI) scheme is presented as a cost-effective approach which may serve as an alternative to the EnKF in some applications. A fairly extensive discussion is devoted to the use of time correlated model errors and the estimation of model bias.},

abstract = {Groundwater storage is a spatial and temporal variable that represents an essential part of the global hydrological cycle. Traditionally, many wells (i.e., a large number), spatially distributed across a basin, are measured annually to monitor changes in the groundwater (GW) level. It has been shown that invasive measuring of water levels in agricultural wells during winter months is most representative because the wells are normally not in use and have had sufficient time to rebound from seasonal use. However, traditional invasive measurements are inefficient, labor-intensive, and expensive with significant regional obstacles that can inhibit good spatial representation. Thus, satellite observations of the Earth's time-variable gravity field from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provide a unique opportunity to monitor changes in groundwater storage from space (Rodell and Famiglietti, 2002; Tapley et al., 2004).},

The summed contribution of the complete system yields a mass loss rate and acceleration of &#8722;252 ± 28 Gt/yr and &#8722;22 ± 4 Gt/yr2 between March 2003 and February 2010 where the error margins follow from two glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models and three processing centers providing GRACE monthly potential coefficient sets. We describe the relation between mass losses in the GS and the EBIS region and found that the uncertainties in all areas are correlated. The summed contribution of Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island, Iceland, and Svalbard yields a mass loss rate of &#8722;51 ± 17 Gt/yr and an acceleration of &#8722;13 ± 3 Gt/yr2 between March 2003 and February 2010.

abstract = {A dual one-way ranging (DOWR) system provides very high accuracy range measurements between two satellites. The GRACE satellite mission implements the DOWR, called KBR (K-band ranging), to measure very small inter-satellite range change in order to map the Earth gravity field. The flight performance of the KBR is analyzed by using a hybrid software simulator that incorporates actual satellite orbit data into a comprehensive KBR simulator, which was earlier used for computing the GRACE baseline accuracy. Three types of experiments were performed. First is the comparison of the flight data with the simulated data in spectral domain. Second is the comparison of double differenced noise level. Third is the comparison of the range-rate difference with GPS clock estimates. The analysis shows a good agreement with the simulation model except some excessive high frequency noise, e.g. 10-4 m/√Hz at 0.1 Hz. The range-rate difference shows 0.003 cyc/s discrepancy with the clock estimates. These analyses are helpful to refine the DOWR simulation model and can be benefit to future DOWR instrument development. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A recurrent power series (RPS) method is constructed for the numerical integration of the equations of motion together with the variational equations of N point masses orbiting around an oblate spheroid. By the term "variational equations" we mean the equations of the partial derivatives of the bodies' position and velocity components with respect to the initial conditions, the relative masses and the spheroid's oblateness coefficients J2 and J4. The construction of recursive relations for the partial derivatives involved in the variational equations is based on partial differentiation of the corresponding recursive relations for the integration of the equations of motion. Since the number of the auxiliary variables needed for this complex system becomes tremendously large when N > 1, special care must be taken during computer implementation, so as to minimize the amount of computer memory needed as well as the cost in CPU time. The RPS method constructed in this way is tested for N = 1,...,4 using real initial conditions of the Saturnian satellite system. For various sets of satellites, we monitor the behaviour of all the corresponding partial derivatives.

abstract = {We analyze the trajectories of three geostationary satellites forming the GEOstationary GRAvitational Wave Interferometer (GEOGRAWI)$\sim$\cite{tinto}, a space-based laser interferometer mission aiming to detect and study gravitational radiation in the ($10^{-4} - 10$) Hz band.   The combined effects of the gravity fields of the Earth, the Sun and the Moon make the three satellites deviate from their nominally stationary, equatorial and equilateral configuration. Since changes in the satellites relative distances and orientations could negatively affect the precision of the laser heterodyne measurements, we have derived the time-dependence of the inter-satellite distances and velocities, the variations of the polar angles made by the constellation's three arms with respect to a chosen reference frame, and the time changes of the triangle's enclosed angles. We find that, during the time between two consecutive station-keeping maneuvers (about two weeks), the relative variations of the inter-satellite distances do not exceed a value of $0.05$ percent, while the relative velocities between pairs of satellites remain smaller than about $0.7 \ {\rm m/s}$. In addition, we find the angles made by the arms of the triangle with the equatorial plane to be periodic functions of time whose amplitudes grow linearly with time; the maximum variations experienced by these angles as well as by those within the triangle remain smaller than $3$ arc-minutes, while the East-West angular variations of the three arms remain smaller than about $15$ arc-minutes during the two-weeks period. The relatively small variations of these orbit parameters result into a set of system functional and performance requirements that are less stringent than those characterizing an interplanetary mission.},

abstract = {I present investigations of Earth dynamics with the superconducting gravimeter GWR T020 at Mets{\"{a}}hovi from 1994 to 2005. As a necessary background, the history and key technical details of the installation are given. Then a new data acquisition system (DAS) developed by the author is described. It has proved reliable and accurate. A pre-requisite for the study of weak phenomena is the removal of the tides from the gravity record and the careful treatment of spikes, offsets and drifts. I present the data processing methods and the development of the local tidal model at Mets{\"{a}}hovi and show that improvements help in the modelling of long-term environmental effects. First, I have used the T020 as a long-period seismometer to study microseismicity and the Earth's free oscillation. I present the annual variation, spectral distribution, amplitude and the sources of microseism at Mets{\"{a}}hovi. High levels of microseism appear to be mainly generated by low-pressure areas (storms) in the Northern Atlantic. I have analyzed free oscillations excited by three large earthquakes: the spectra, attenuation and rotational splitting of the modes. An air pressure correction is required to bring down the noise level. The lowest modes of all different oscillation types are studied, i.e. the radial mode 0S0 , the “football mode” 0S2, and the toroidal mode 0T2. This last-mentioned mode is very weak in the vertical as the component is only generated through the Coriolis coupling. I have also detected the very low level (0.01 nms-1) incessant excitation of the Earth's free oscillation with the T020. The recovery of global and regional variations in gravity with the superconducting gravimeter requires the modelling of local gravity effects. The most important of them is hydrology. The variation in the groundwater level at Mets{\"{a}}hovi as measured in a borehole in the fractured bedrock correlates significantly (0.79) with gravity. The range of the gravity effect is 70 nms-2 and this phenomenon must be taken into account at an early stage of data processing. The influence of local precipitation, soil moisture and snow cover are detectable in the gravity record. A fortuitous experiment powerfully demonstrated the effect of snow on the laboratory roof, on that occasion -20 nms-2. The gravity effect of the variation in atmospheric mass (range about 300 nms-2) and that of the non-tidal loading by the Baltic Sea (range about 50 nms-2) were investigated together, as sea level and air pressure are correlated. The effects were modelled both using regression on the local barometer and tide gauge, and with a Green's function formalism based a detailed model of the load. In the regression approach, there is a trade-off between the coefficients. Using Green's functions it was calculated that a 1 metre uniform layer of water in the Baltic Sea increases the gravity at Mets{\"{a}}hovi by 31 nms-2 and the vertical deformation is –11 mm. Best results were obtained using the HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model) for the atmosphere. Regression on the sea level in Helsinki then decreases the RMS of gravity residuals by 16%, i.e. explains about 30% of their variance. The regression coefficient for sea level is 27 nms-2m-1, which is 87% of the uniform model. These studies are associated with temporal height variations using the GPS data of Mets{\"{a}}hovi permanent station. Loading by air pressure and the Baltic Sea explains about 40% of the variance of daily GPS height solution.},

abstract = {The terrestrial reference frame is a cornerstone for modern geodesy and its applications for a wide range of Earth sciences. The underlying assumption for establishing a terrestrial reference frame is that the motion of the solid Earth's figure centre relative to the mass centre of the Earth system on a multidecadal timescale is linear. However, past international terrestrial reference frames (ITRFs) showed unexpected accelerated motion in their translation parameters. Based on this underlying assumption, the inconsistency of relative origin motions of the ITRFs has been attributed to data reduction imperfection. We investigated the impact of surface mass loading from atmosphere, ocean, snow, soil moisture, ice sheet, glacier and sea level from 1983 to 2008 on the geocentre variations. The resultant geocentre time-series display notable trend acceleration from 1998 onward, in particular in the z-component. This effect is primarily driven by the hydrological mass redistribution in the continents (soil moisture, snow, ice sheet and glacier). The acceleration is statistically significant at the 99 per cent confidence level as determined using the Mann–Kendall test, and it is highly correlated with the satellite laser ranging determined translation series. Our study, based on independent geophysical and hydrological models, demonstrates that, in addition to systematic errors from analysis procedures, the observed non-linearity of the Earth-system behaviour at interannual timescales is physically driven and is able to explain 42 per cent of the disparity between the origins of ITRF2000 and ITRF2005, as well as the high level of consistency between the ITRF2005 and ITRF2008 origins.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 COSPAR. The high repetition rate Satellite Laser Ranging system Graz delivers the millimeter precision range measurements to the corner cube reflector panels of Ajisai. The analysis of 4599 passes measured from October 2003 until November 2014 reveals the secular precession and nutation of Ajisai spin axis due to the gravitational forces as predicted by Kubo (1987) with the periods of 35.6. years and 116.5. days respectively. The observed precession cone is oriented at RA = 88.9°, Dec = -88.85° (J2000) and has a radius of 1.08°. The radius of the nutation cone increases from 1.32° to 1.57° over the 11. years of the measurements. We also detect a draconitic wobbling of Ajisai orientation due to the 'motion' of the Sun about the satellite's orbit.The observed spin period of Ajisai increases exponentially over the investigated time span according to the trend function: T = 1.492277{\textperiodcentered}exp(0.0148388{\textperiodcentered}. Y) [s], where Y is in years since launch (1986.6133), RMS = 0.412. ms. The physical simulation model fitted to the observed spin parameters proves a very low interaction between Ajisai and the Earth's magnetic field, what assures that the satellite's angular momentum vector will remain in the vicinity of the south celestial pole for the coming decades.The developed empirical model of the spin axis orientation can improve the accuracy of the range determination between the ground SLR systems and the satellite's center-of-mass (Kucharski et al., 2015) and enable the accurate attitude prediction of Ajisai for the laser time-transfer experiments (Kunimori et al., 1992).},

abstract = {bstract. Ice-shelf buttressing and the stability of marine-type ice sheets are investigated numerically. Buttressing effects are analysed for a situation where a stable grounding line is located on a bed sloping upwards in the direction of flow. Such grounding-line positions are known to be unconditionally unstable in the absence of transverse flow variations. It is shown that ice-shelf buttressing can restore stability under these conditions. Ice flux at the grounding line is, in general, not a monotonically increasing function of ice thickness. This, possibly at first somewhat counterintuitive result, is found to be fully consistent with recent theoretical work. Grounding lines on retrograde slopes are conditionally stable, and the stability regime is a non-trivial function of bed and ice-shelf geometry. The stability of grounding lines cannot be assessed from considerations of local bed slope only.},

Total water storage (TWS) trends from the GRACE satellite observations were also used to assist the assessment. The objectives are to quantify the magnitudes and spatial patterns of the water budget imbalance (e) and its source of errors for these cold region basins. Results showed that the water budget was closed within 10% of the P on average for all the basins. The e showed a general pattern of positive values in the south and negative values in the north and mountainous regions over the country. Basins with large e values were mostly found in the north. Uncertainties in the water budget variables, particularly P, were found to play a major role in the e. Significant trends in TWS were found over 11 basins, which accounted for 31% of their e on average. Improvements in the observation network, data quality assurance, and spatial models for P are critical for further improving the water budget closure for the cold region drainage basins. � 2014 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

We compare present and expected future accuracies of the ice mass balance of Antarctica which might be constrained to 0.1–0.3 mm/year of sea level equivalent by satellite gravity data. A key issue for the understanding of ice mass balance is the separation of secular and interannual variations. For this aim, one would strongly benefit from longer uninterrupted time series of gravity field variations (10 years or more). An accuracy of 0.01 mm/year for geoid time variability with a spatial resolution of 100 km would improve the separability of ice mass balance from mass change due to glacial isostatic adjustment and enable the determination of regional variations in ice mass balance within the ice sheets. Thereby the determination of ice compaction is critical for the exploitation of such high accuracy data. A further benefit of improved gravity field models from future satellite missions would be the improvement of the height reference in the polar areas, which is important for the study of coastal ice processes. Sea ice thickness determination and modelling of ice bottom topography could be improved as well.},

abstract = {Using orbital simulations of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) spacecraft, we examined the effects on gravity recovery due to short period, non-tidal temporal mass variability in the atmosphere, ocean, and continental hydrology. We found that the magnitude of the aliasing error was strongly correlated with the power of the high-frequency variability of the models. Degree error relative to measurement error increased by a factor of ∼20 due to atmospheric aliasing (corresponding to geoid anomalies of approximately 1 mm at 500 km wavelengths), by a factor of ∼10 due to the ocean model, and by a factor of ∼3 due to the continental hydrology model. De-aliasing done with approximate models gave the greatest reduction in aliasing error for the mid-degrees and higher. For the atmosphere, the residual error was ∼1/5 times that of the aliasing error. A barotropic ocean model reduced the aliasing error due to a baroclinic model to nearly the level of measurement noise.},

abstract = {We sketch the evolution of station trajectory models used in crustal motion geodesy over the last sev- eral decades, and describe some recent generalizations of these models that allow geodesists and geophysicists to para- meterize accelerating patterns of displacement in general, and postseismic transient deformation in particular. Mod- ern trajectory models are composed of three sub-models that represent secular trends, annual oscillations, and instan- taneous jumps in coordinate time series. Traditionally the trend model invoked constant station velocity. This can be generalized by assuming that position is a polynomial func- tion of time. The trajectory model can also be augmented as needed, by including one or more logarithmic transients in order to account for typical multi-year patterns of post- seismic transient motion. Many geodetic and geophysical research groups are using general classes of trajectory model to characterize their crustal displacement time series, but few if any of them are using these trajectory models to define and realize the terrestrial reference frames (RFs) in which their time series are expressed. We describe a global GPS reanaly- sis program in which we use two general classes of trajec- tory model, tuned on a station by station basis. We define the network trajectory model as the set of station trajectory models encompassing every station in the network. We use the network trajectory model from the each global analysis to assign prior position estimates for the next round of GPS data processing. We allow our daily orbital solutions to relax so as to maintain their consistency with the network poly- hedron. After several iterations we produce GPS time series expressed in a RF similar to, but not identical with ITRF2008. M. Bevis ( B ) {\textperiodcentered} A. Brown Division of Geodetic Sciences, School of Earth Sciences, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA e-mail: mbevis@osu.edu We find that each iteration produces an improvement in the daily repeatability of our global time series and in the pre- dictive power of our trajectory models.},

abstract = {Observing mass transport with the highest possible accuracy and spatial resolution and with temporal resolutions from daily to monthly is crucial for understanding the functioning and evolution of the system Earth (climate, geo-hazards, water cycle). GRACE and GOCE have shown the great potential and uniqueness of observing mass distribution and transport from space and the need for not only sustained, but also improved observation of global mass transport in terms of temporal and spatial resolution. Such improvements would benefit a diversity of Earth science domains (e.g. hydrology, oceanography, cryospheric sciences, solid Earth sciences, atmospheric sciences) for both scientific and application focused users, and are necessary to fully characterize diverse global change processes. Specifically, improved spatial and temporal resolution of global mass transport would allow for: (1) an enhancement of our ability to monitor, model and predict changes in the global water cycle, including extreme events, (2) the ability to separate mass balance processes on the ice sheets (glacial dynamics and surface mass balance), ultimately allowing for improved predictions of sea level rise through ice sheet model validation, (3) monitoring and understanding climate- relevant variations of two important ocean currents: the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and (4) monitoring mass changes linked to large earthquakes and other solid-Earth processes. Mass transport observations provide information on several essential climate variables defined by GGOS. Due to the importance and uniqueness of mass transport observations, we recommend to include mass transport explicitly as an essential climate variable.},

abstract = {A new satellite mission to map the Earth's gravitational field (GRACE) is based on inter-satellite tracking using micro-wave ranging which can be used to solve for parameters of a global spherical harmonic model of the gravitational field using traditional satellite orbital perturbation analysis. An alternative algorithm has been developed to use the inter-satellite range-rate, supplemented by GPS baseline vector velocities and accelerometer data, to estimate in situ geopotential differences. The collection of these data, treated as a set of boundary values in potential theory, should yield higher geopotential resolution in the polar latitudes than provided by a truncated spherical harmonic model because of the high concentration of data in these areas. On the other hand, in situ data must be downward continued for local geoid determination, whereas this is already incorporated in the spherical harmonic models. Simulations confirm that although spherical harmonic estimations also yield relatively higher accuracy near the poles, local geoid estimation from in situ geopotential difference measurements is even more accurate at the poles, by a factor of two or higher for the case of nineteen days' worth of GRACE data.},

abstract = {The lunar gravity field is a foundation to study the lunar interior structure, and to recover the evolution history of the Moon. It is still an open and key topic for lunar science. For above mentioned reasons, it becomes one of the important scientific objectives of recent lunar missions, such as KAGUYA (SELENE) the Japanese lunar mission and Chang'E-1, the Chinese lunar mission. The Chang'E-1 and the SELENE were successfully launched in 2007. It is estimated that these two missions can fly around the Moon longer than 6 months simultaneously. In these two missions, the Chinese new VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) network will be applied for precise orbit determination (POD) by using a differential VLBI (D-VLBI) method during the mission period. The same-beam D-VLBI technique will contribute to recover the lunar gravity field together with other conventional observables, i.e. R&RR (Range and Range Rate) and multi-way Doppler. Taking VLBI tracking conditions into consideration and using the GEODYNII/SOVLE software of GSFC/NASA/USA [Rowlands, D.D., Marshall, J.A., Mccarthy, J., et al. GEODYN II System Description, vols. 1-5. Contractor Report, Hughes STX Corp. Greenbelt, MD, 1997; Ullman, R.E. SOLVE program: mathematical formulation and guide to user input, Hughes/STX Contractor Report, Contract NAS5-31760. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, 1994], we simulated the lunar gravity field recovering ability with and without D-VLBI between the Chang'E-1 and SELENE main satellite. The cases of overlapped flying and tracking period of 30 days, 60 days and 90 days have been analyzed, respectively. The results show that D-VLBI tracking between two lunar satellites can improve the gravity field recovery remarkably. The results and methods introduced in this paper will benefit the actual missions. ?? 2007 COSPAR.},

abstract = {For over a decade, the Delft precise ERS-1 and ERS-2 orbits have been used in many scientific investigations based on ERS altimeter and interferometric SAR data. This orbit computation is now continued for Envisat, with an unprecedented accuracy due to better tracking data and lower force model errors. Orbit errors due to inaccuracies in the Earth's gravity model, which have been the main focus of research during the 1990s, have been reduced to a lower level than those incurred by errors in measurement modelling and non-gravitational force modelling. We have compared several models and methods in order to investigate and where possible reduce each of the error sources. When reprocessing the tracking data over the solar maximum period of the past years, frequent large and unpredictable changes in thermospheric density form the dominant remaining source of orbit error, for which accurate modelling remains a difficulty. Nevertheless, the quality of our Envisat precise orbits already rivals that of TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason. The orbit quality will likely further improve as solar activity continues to drop towards solar minimum.},

It is shown that the global mean error of the lunar gravity field can be reduced to less than 0.1 mGal at a spatial resolution of 50 km. In the spectral domain, this means a factor of 10 (long wavelengths) and some 100 (mid to short wavelengths) improvement as compared to predictions for SELENE or a factor of 1000 with respect to LP150Q. Furthermore, a higher spatial resolution of up to 28 km seems feasible and would correspond to a factor of 2-3 improvement of SELENE results. Moreover, PRARE-L is expected to derive the low-degree coefficients of the lunar gravity field with unprecedented accuracy. Considering long mission duration (at least 1 year is planned) this would allow for the first time a precise direct determination of the low-degree tidal Love numbers of the Moon and, in combination with high precision SEST, would provide an experimental basis to study relativistic effects such as the periselenium advance in the Earth-Moon system. ?? 2008 COSPAR.},

abstract = {In current global positioning system (GPS) applications, receiver clocks are typically estimated epoch-wise in the data analyses even for clocks with high performance like Hydrogen-masers (H-maser). Applying an appropriate clock model for high-stability receiver clocks should, in view of the strong correlation between the station height and the clock parameters, significantly improve the positioning results. Recent experiments have shown that modeling the deterministic behavior of high-quality receiver clocks can improve the kinematic precise point positioning considerably. In this paper, well-behaving ground clocks are studied in detail applying constraints between subsequent and near-subsequent clock parameters. The influence of different weights for these relative clock constraints on the positioning quality, especially on the height, is investigated. For excellent clocks, an improvement of up to a factor of 3 can be obtained for the repeatability of the kinematic height estimates. This may be essential to detect small but sudden changes in the vertical component (e. g., caused by earthquakes). Troposphere zenith path delays (ZPD) are also heavily correlated with the receiver clock estimates and station heights. All these parameters are usually estimated simultaneously. We show that the use of relative clock constraints allows for a higher time resolution of the ZPD estimates (smaller than 2 h) without compromising the quality of the kinematic height estimates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This effect has been detected in, at least, six flybys of the Earth but it has not appeared in other recent flybys. In order to find a pattern in these, apparently contradictory, data several phenomenological formulas have been proposed but all have failed to predict a new result in agreement with the observations. In this paper we use a multivariate dimensional analysis approach to propose a fitting of the data in terms of the local parameters at perigee, as it would occur if this anomaly comes from an unknown fifth force with latitude dependence. Under this assumption, we estimate the range of this force around 300 km.},

abstract = {The striking improvements in long- to medium-wavelengths gravity field recovery achieved with GPS-CHAMP and GPS-GRACE high-low and GRACE K-band range low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking prompted us to combine the satellite data with surface data from altimetry over the oceans and gravimetry over the continents to generate a new, high resolution global gravity field model: EIGEN-CG01C. The model is complete to degree/order 360 in terms of spherical harmonics and resolves half-wavelengths of 55 km in the geoid and gravity anomaly fields. A special band-limited combination method has been applied in order to preserve the high accuracy from the satellite data in the lower frequency band of the geopotential and to allow for a smooth transition to the high-frequency band, dominated by the surface data. Compared to pre-CHAMP/GRACE global high-resolution gravity field models, the accuracy was improved by one order of magnitude to 4 cm and 0.5 mgal in terms of geoid heights and gravity anomalies, respectively, at a spatial resolution of 200 km half-wavelength. The overall accuracy at degree/order 360 is estimated to be 20 cm and 5 mgal, respectively, and benefits significantly from recently released new gravity anomaly compilations over the polar regions. In general, the accuracy over the oceans is better than over the continents reflecting the higher quality of the available surface data.},

abstract = {The formation control of a long-distance, drag-free, low-thrust, low-Earth orbit satellite is outlined, in view of future Earth-gravity monitoring missions employing long baseline interferometry (>10 km) and lasting at least six years. To this purpose, a formation consisting of two drag-free satellites, orbiting at a fixed distance in a sun-synchronous orbit, has been proposed. Formation fluctuations are bounded by a 500??50??50 m3 wide (along-track, cross-track and radial) box. Although at first not seemingly demanding, the formation control induces non-gravitational accelerations, that are obliged to respect tight drag-free requirements, and are constrained by millinewton thrust bounds so as to curtail electric thruster throttability. In addition, formation fluctuations due to tide forces should not be impaired as their measurement is the mission goal. Requirements are formulated as a set of four time and frequency-domain inequalities, which are suitably parameterized by control gains. By exploiting the properties and asymptotic approximations of close-loop Hills equation, explicit design inequalities are obtained leading to a first-trial control design. Simulated runs through fine spacecraft and low-Earth-orbit simulation, which is dominated by a highly variable thermosphere drag, show that the first-trial design meets the tight control requirements, and demonstrates mission feasibility. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has provided an unprecedented global, homogeneous observational data set of time variation in terrestrial water storage since 2002. The typical GRACE product uses approximately 30 equally weighted days of data to estimate a monthly mean gravity field with 300+ km resolution. The coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the typical GRACE solution, however, limits scientific analysis to primarily seasonal and long-term hydrological processes. In this study, we enhance the temporal and spatial resolution of the GRACE data product through the use of sliding windows, regularization, and mascon basis functions in the estimation process. Each regularized sliding window mascon (RSWM) gravity field is composed of 21 days of observational data differentially weighted to optimize the frequency retention while ensuring sufficient observability for a global solution. Tikhonov regularization informed by RL05 error is applied in the estimation process, and the product is derived in mascon basis functions to increase the amplitude and localization of signal retention. The final RSWM data product is the first daily time-variable gravity data set created solely from GRACE information. The improved filter design reduces aliasing, increases the signal bandwidth, and better captures the amplitude and power of geophysical signals. Comparison with land surface model and in situ data sets shows a similar spatial and temporal signal content at all frequencies within the filter bandwidth and highlights the overall accuracy of the product. The new data set expands opportunities for scientific analysis of subseasonal terrestrial water storage variability.},

abstract = {Temporal and mean gravity field models derived from the twin-satellite, leader-follower mission GRACE have provided a new type of information for Earth sciences. In this contribution, we study the potential of various alternative satellite formations for gravity field determination in the post-GRACE era in a simulation environment. In particular, the effects of spherical harmonic truncation and of temporal aliasing in the processing of gravity products from such future formations are investigated. Temporal aliasing is studied based on simulated observations of satellite formation flight (SFF) configurations and simulated errors in short-term background models for the non-tidal atmosphere, ocean masses and the continental water storage. We study the potential improvement of SFF gravity field solutions in terms of spherical harmonics truncation of up to degree/order 100. Furthermore, we simulate the recovery of the hydrological signal from various SFF configurations with and without the contamination of the aliasing errors, which were derived from model differences. We implement full-scale simulations for all scenarios to assess the quality of future gravity products in the form of spherical harmonic models. To this end, we create simulated measurements for four satellite configurations (known as pendulum, the radial Cartwheel, the LISA and the pendulum-3S) besides the GRACE-type configuration as a reference. All simulations are restricted to a time span of one month to limit computation costs. As expected, the gravity field products derived from future SFF configurations may surpass those obtained from GRACE in terms of isotropy of the gravity field. Our study provides detailed results for many scenarios ranging in terms of spherical harmonic truncation to up to 100 for mean and temporal solutions. Furthermore, we show that specific SFF configurations involving radial and cross-track information strengthen the recovery of the gravitational signal; in addition they are able to significantly reduce the aliasing errors appearing in the temporal GRACE gravity field monthly solutions. Following this, we suggest to fly a future mission in pendulum configuration. ?? 2012 COSPAR.},

abstract = {The spatial truncation error (STE) is a significant systematic error in the integral inversion of satellite gradiometric and orbital data to gravity anomalies at sea level. In order to reduce the effect of STE, a larger area than the desired one is considered in the inversion process, but the anomalies located in its central part are selected as the final results. The STE influences the variance of the results as well because the residual vector, which is contaminated with STE, is used for its estimation. The situation is even more complicated in variance component estimation because of its iterative nature. In this paper, we present a strategy to reduce the effect of STE on the a posteriori variance factor and the variance components for inversion of satellite orbital and gradiometric data to gravity anomalies at sea level. The idea is to define two windowing matrices for reducing this error from the estimated residuals and anomalies. Our simulation studies over Fennoscandia show that the differences between the 0.5°×0.5° gravity anomalies obtained from orbital data and an existing gravity model have standard deviation (STD) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 10.9 and 12.1 mGal, respectively, and those obtained from gradiometric data have 7.9 and 10.1 in the same units. In the case that they are combined using windowed variance components the STD and RMSE become 6.1 and 8.4 mGal. Also, the mean value of the estimated RMSE after using the windowed variances is in agreement with the RMSE of the differences between the estimated anomalies and those obtained from the gravity model. {\textcopyright} 2014 COSPAR.},

The Bayesian model says that the investigator should use a prior distribution but it does not give information about the prior distribution. The investigator can select any prior, which he or she needs. In origin, the choice should precisely display the investigator's knowledge about the study. The posterior is very sensitive to the choice of prior, and the range of posterior chances would be higher. The differentiation between Bayesian and classical statistics would be of only philosophical interest if both approaches led to similar findings. The question of sensitivity is a question of whether the probability function is sharply peaked relative to priors in a practical class.

abstract = {We investigate the mass balance of East Antarctica for the period 2003–2013 using a Bayesian statistical framework. We combine satellite altimetry, gravimetry, and GPS with prior assumptions characterizing the underlying geophysical processes. We run three experiments based on two different assumptions to study possible solutions to the mass balance. We solve for trends in surface mass balance, ice dynamics, and glacial isostatic adjustment. The first assumption assigns low probability to ice dynamic mass loss in regions of slow flow, giving a mean dynamic trend of 17 ± 10 Gt yr−1 and a total mass imbalance of 57 ± 20 Gt yr−1. The second assumption considers a long-term dynamic thickening hypothesis and an a priori solution for surface mass balance from a regional climate model. The latter results in estimates 3 to 5 times larger for the ice dynamic trends but similar total mass imbalance. In both cases, gains in East Antarctica are smaller than losses in West Antarctica.},

abstract = {Goddard Ocean Tide model GOT99.2 is a new solution for the amplitudes and phases of the global oceanic tides, based on over six years of sea-surface height measurements by the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeter. Comparison with deep-ocean tide-gauge measurements show that this new tidal solution is an improvement over previous global models, with accuracies for the main semidiurnal lunar constituent M2 now below 1.5 cm (deep water only). The new solution benefits from use of prior hydrodynamic models, several in shallow and inland seas as well as the global finite-element model FES94.1. This report describes some of the data processing details involved in handling the altimetry, and it provides a comprehensive set of global cotidal charts of the resulting solutions. Various derived tidal charts are also provided, including tidal loading deformation charts, tidal gravimetric charts, and tidal current velocity (or transport) charts. Finally, low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients are computed by numerical quadrature and are tabulated for the major short-period tides; these are useful for a variety of geodetic and geophysical purposes, especially in combination with similar estimates from satellite laser ranging.},

abstract = {Computations of Fourier coefficients and related integrals of the associated Legendre functions with a new method along with their application to spherical harmonics analysis and synthesis are presented. The method incorporates a stable three-step recursion equation that can be processed separately for each colatitudinal Fourier wavenumber. Recursion equations for the zonal and sectorial modes are derived in explicit single-term formulas to provide accurate initial condition. Stable computations of the Fourier coefficients as well as the integrals needed for the projection of Legendre functions are demonstrated for the ultra-high degree of 10,800 corresponding to the resolution of one arcmin. Fourier coefficients, computed in double precision, are found to be accurate to 15 significant digits, indicating that the normalized error is close to the machine round-off error. The orthonormality, evaluated with Fourier coefficients and related integrals, is shown to be accurate to O (10 −15 ) for degrees and orders up to 10,800. The Legendre function of degree 10,800 and order 5,000, synthesized from Fourier coefficients, is accurate to the machine round-off error. Further extension of the method to even higher degrees seems to be realizable without significant deterioration of accuracy. The Fourier series is applied to the projection of Legendre functions to the high-resolution global relief data of the National Geophysical Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the spherical harmonic degree variance (power spectrum) of global relief data is discussed.},

abstract = {We adopt the cross wavelet transform (XWT) to examine the potential geophysical contributors of seasonal oscillations in GPS observations. Daily vertical GPS position time series and mass loadings [atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological loading (AOH)] of 30 globally distributed GPS sites, spanning from January 2002 to December 2014, are used to quantify the performance. First, we examine the spectra of GPS time series and AOH. The results confirm the anomalous sub-seasonal peaks in GPS spectra are seen to have not an obvious geophysical explanation. The Akaike information criteria is then used to quantify how well the noise models fit the two series. The Generalized Gauss Markov plus white noise (GGM + WH) model is in most cases the preferred noise model for GPS, and the fifth order autoregressive plus white noise (AR(5) + WH) model is the preferred noise model for AOH. Second, we test the significance of periodic oscillations in GPS residuals and AOH. We find both series have significantly high power located near one cycle per year frequency band, whereas harmonic signals at higher draconitic frequency are identified as non-white process. Finally, we adopt XWT to examine the relative phasing between the two series, and find the annual variations in two series are physically related for most sites. The time variable phase asynchrony obtained using the XWT-based semblance analysis confirms that the annual variations in GPS observations are resulting from a combination of geophysical signals and systematic errors. The weighted least squares fitting method where the covariance matrix follows a specific stochastic noise model is also performed for comparison.},

The differences between geopotential numbers and normal heights in mean and zero tidal system are examined. For data source, four levelling lines from the National First Order Levelling Network are used. In addition, a comparison between the calculated normal heights and the official data published in the “Catalogue of the National First Order Levelling Network Benchmarks in European Vertical Reference System 2007” is made. At the end of the paper, proposals for the proper choice of tidal system in the country are given, taking into account future international as well as local precise geodetic applications.},

Infor- mation from the IERS Bulletin A was required to generate the predicted part of the old CODE ultra-rapid product. The current (‘‘new'') product, activated in November 2013, is based on the output of exactly one multi-day solution. A priori information from the IERS Bulletin A is no longer required for generating and predicting the orbits and ERPs. This article discusses the transition from the old to the new CODE ultra-rapid orbit and ERP products and the associ- ated improvement in reliability and performance. All solutions used in this article were generated with the development version of the Bernese GNSS Software.

@article{Bezdek2014,
abstract = {The aim of our work is to generate Earth's gravity field models from GPS positions of low Earth orbiters. Our inversion method is based on Newton's second law, which relates the observed acceleration of the satellite with forces acting on it. The observed acceleration is obtained as numerical second derivative of kinematic positions. Observation equations are formulated using the gradient of the spherical harmonic expansion of the geopotential. Other forces are either modelled (lunisolar perturbations, tides) or provided by onboard measurements (nongravitational perturbations). From this linear regression model the geopotential harmonic coefficients are obtained. To this basic scheme of the acceleration approach we added some original elements, which may be useful in other inversion techniques as well. We tried to develop simple, straightforward and still statistically correct model of observations. (i) The model is linear in the harmonic coefficients, no a priori gravity field model is needed, no regularization is applied. (ii) We use the generalized least squares to successfully mitigate the strong amplification of noise due to numerical second derivative. (iii) The number of other fitted parameters is very small, in fact we use only daily biases, thus we can monitor their behaviour. (iv) GPS positions have correlated errors. The sample autocorrelation function and especially the partial autocorrelation function indicate suitability of an autoregressive model to represent the correlation structure. The decorrelation of residuals improved the accuracy of harmonic coefficients by a factor of 2–3. (v) We found it better to compute separate solutions in the three local reference frame directions than to compute them together at the same time; having obtained separate solutions for along-track, cross-track and radial components, we combine them using the normal matrices. Relative contribution of the along-track component to the combined solution is 50 percent on average. (vi) The computations were performed on an ordinary PC up to maximum degree and order 120. We applied the presented method to orbits of CHAMP and GRACE spanning seven years (2003–2009) and to two months of GOCE (Nov/Dec 2009). The obtained long-term static gravity field models are of similar or better quality compared to other published solutions. We also tried to extract the time-variable gravity signal from CHAMP and GRACE orbits. The acquired average annual signal shows clearly the continental areas with important and known hydrological variations.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission will resolve temporal variations in gravity orders of magnitude more accurately and with considerably higher resolution than any existing satellite. Effects of atmospheric mass over land will be removed prior to estimating the gravitational field, using surface pressure fields generated by global weather forecast centers. To recover the continental hydrological signal with an accuracy of 1 cm of equivalent water thickness down to scales of a few hundred kilometers, atmospheric pressure must be known to an accuracy of 1 mbar or better. We estimate errors in analyzed pressure fields and the impact of those errors on GRACE surface mass estimates by comparing analyzed fields with barometric surface pressure measurements in the United States and North Africa/Arabian peninsula. We consider (1) the error in 30-day averages of the pressure field, significant because the final GRACE product will average measurements collected over 30-day intervals, and (2) the short-period error in the pressure fields which would be aliased by GRACE orbital passes. Because the GRACE results will average surface mass over scales of several hundred kilometers, we assess the pressure field accuracy averaged over those same spatial scales. The atmospheric error over the 30-day averaging period, which will map directly into GRACE data, is generally < 0.5 mbar. Consequently, analyzed pressure fields will be adequate to remove the atmospheric contribution from GRACE hydrological estimates to sub centimeter levels. However, the short-period error in the pressure field, which would alias into GRACE data, could potentially contribute errors equivalent to 1 cm of water thickness. We also show that given sufficiently dense barometric coverage, an adequate surface pressure field can be constructed from surface pressure measurements alone.},

@article{Klees2006,
abstract = {The estimation of terrestrial water storage varia-tions at river basin scale is among the best documented ap-plications of the GRACE (Gravity and Climate Experiment) satellite gravity mission. In particular, it is expected that GRACE closes the water balance at river basin scale and al-lows the verification, improvement and modeling of the re-lated hydrological processes by combining GRACE ampli-tude estimates with hydrological models' output and in-situ data. When computing monthly mean storage variations from GRACE gravity field models, spatial filtering is mandatory to reduce GRACE errors, but at the same time yields biased amplitude estimates. The objective of this paper is three-fold. Firstly, we want to compute and analyze amplitude and time behaviour of the bias in GRACE estimates of monthly mean water storage variations for several target areas in Southern Africa. In par-ticular, we want to know the relation between bias and the choice of the filter correlation length, the size of the target area, and the amplitude of mass variations inside and outside the target area. Secondly, we want to know to what extent the bias can be corrected for using a priori information about mass variations. Thirdly, we want to quantify errors in the estimated bias due to uncertainties in the a priori information about mass variations that are used to compute the bias. The target areas are located in Southern Africa around the Zambezi river basin. The latest release of monthly GRACE gravity field models have been used for the period from Jan-uary 2003 until March 2006. An accurate and properly cal-ibrated regional hydrological model has been developed for this area and its surroundings and provides the necessary a priori information about mass variations inside and outside the target areas. Correspondence to: R. Klees (r.klees@tudelft.nl) The main conclusion of the study is that spatial smoothing significantly biases GRACE estimates of the amplitude of an-nual and monthly mean water storage variations and that bias correction using existing hydrological models significantly improves the quality of GRACE estimates. For most of the practical applications, the bias will be positive, which im-plies that GRACE underestimates the amplitudes. The bias is mainly determined by the filter correlation length; in the case of 1000 km smoothing, which is shown to be an appro-priate choice for the target areas, the annual bias attains val-ues up to 50% of the annual storage; the monthly bias is even larger with a maximum value of 75% of the monthly storage. A priori information about mass variations can provide rea-sonably accurate estimates of the bias, which significantly improves the quality of GRACE water storage amplitudes. For the target areas in Southern Africa, we show that after bias correction, GRACE annual amplitudes differ between 0 and 30 mm from the output of a regional hydrological model, which is between 0% and 25% of the storage. Annual phase shifts are small, not exceeding 0.25 months, i.e. 7.5 deg. It is shown that after bias correction, the fit between GRACE and a hydrological model is overoptimistic, if the same hydrolog-ical model is used to estimate the bias and to compare with GRACE. If another hydrological model is used to compute the bias, the fit is less, although the improvement is still very significant compared with uncorrected GRACE estimates of water storage variations. Therefore, the proposed approach for bias correction works for the target areas subject to this study. It may also be an option for other target areas pro-vided that some reasonable a priori information about water storage variations are available.

abstract = {The GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) mission, launched on March 2009, included a new type of satellite instrument, an on-board three-axis gradiometer able to measure the Earth's gravity gradients at the satellite height (255 km). The potential of this new type of measurement and its derived products (i.e., global gravity field models), together with other land-based geophysical observables (Bouguer and geoid anomalies), to image sub-lithospheric thermal and compositional anomalies is evaluated in this study. We focus on the Atlantic-Mediterranean Transition Region (AMTR), the diffuse, transpressive contact between the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. The present-day lithospheric structure in the area is characterized by a wide band of active deformation, large lateral variationsin the lithosphere and the presence of a positive seismic-velocity anomaly in the uppermost mantle beneath the Betics and the westernmost Alboran Basin-Gibraltar Arc. Here, the perturbing effects of deep, sub-lithospheric density anomalies in GOCE gravity gradients and other land-based geophysical data are assessed, and its impact in lithospheric-scale geophysical-petrological modeling within a ther-modynamically consistent framework analyzed. Some of the gravity gradients computed at the satellite altitude are rather sensitive to the presence of even a relatively small sub-lithospheric cold slab, like theone observed in the AMTR, showing the potential of the new GOCE data to map upper mantle anomalies. Lithospheric models ignoring the AMTR sub-lithospheric heterogeneities could be significantly biased. In particular, extreme changes of 4-6 km and 60-70 km in the crustal and lithospheric thickness, respectively, are required to include sub-lithospheric mantle contributions to land-based and satellite gravitydata.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Carrier-phase integer ambiguity resolution (IAR) is the key to highly precise, fast positioning and attitude determination with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). It can be seen as the process of estimating the unknown cycle ambiguities of the carrier-phase observations as integers. Once the ambiguities are fixed, carrier phase data will act as the very precise range data. Integer aperture (IA) ambiguity resolution is the combination of acceptance testing and integer ambiguity resolution, which can realize better quality control of IAR. Difference test (DT) is one of the most popular acceptance tests. This contribution will give a detailed analysis about the following properties of IA ambiguity resolution based on DT:1.The sharpest and loose upper bounds of DT are derived from the perspective of geometry. These bounds are very simple and easy to be computed, which give the range for the critical values of DT.2.The definition of DT integer aperture bootstrapping (IAB) estimator is firstly given. The relationships between DT-IAB and DT-IA are deeply investigated, which also firstly give a new perspective to review the IAB and IA least square (IALS) estimators.3.Based on the properties of the second best integer candidates in integer least square and integer bootstrapping estimators, the definition of DT-IA is given from another perspective, which is mathematically equivalent to its original definition.4.The analytical expressions of the success rate lower bound and upper bound of DT-IA estimator are firstly derived. Then, the quality measure for DT-IA estimator can be completely calculated as integer estimator without measurements. Both sharp and loose bounds of DT-IA success rate are given so that the success rates are easily evaluated, which also can provide reasonable approximation for DT-IA estimator. All these conclusions are verified based on the single and combination GNSS simulation experiments. The experiment results indicate the correctness of these conclusions. These properties demonstrate the special properties of DT-IA estimator, and also provide the research frame to investigate other IA estimators. They are helpful to realize better use of IA estimators in quality control and precise positioning in future.},

abstract = {Since the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites broadcast signals travel a long distance, the received signals are attenuated below the thermal noise level. Such weak signals are seriously subject to intentional or unintentional interferences from hostile or friendly noise sources. We propose an NN-based predictor for GPS anti-jamming applications. This new method exploits the adaptive notch filter as a cascade filter and the simple structure of Sigma-Pi neural network ($\Sigma$-$\Pi$ NN). The $\Sigma$-$\Pi$ NN can be trained quickly while avoiding the huge exponential computation for updating weights and thresholds in each layer, which allows easy hardware implementation. Simulation results show that its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement factor exceeds the factors of conventional multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural network, and other compound methods in single-tone and multi-tone continuous wave interference environments. Besides improving SNR, the anti-jamming performances are evaluated by computing root mean squared (RMS) prediction error and space vehicle (SV) observation number. The proposed algorithm provides the desired SV observation number, even for more than four vehicles, increases SNR improvement by about 46 % on average, and reduces RMS by about 27 % in average in both jamming mitigation processes.},

abstract = {Over a quarter century ago, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) released the equations and source code used to predict satellite positions through SpaceTrack Report Number 3 (STR3). Because the DoD's two-line element sets (TLEs) were the only source of orbital data, widely available through NASA, this code became commonplace among users needing accurate results. However, end users made code changes to correct the implementation of the equations and to handle rare cases encountered in operations. These changes migrated into numerous new versions and compiled programs outside the DoD. Changes made to the original STR3 code have not been released in a comprehensive form to the public, so the code available to the public no longer matches the code used by DoD to produce the TLEs. Fortunately, independent efforts, technical papers, and source code enabled us to synthesize a non-proprietary version which we believe is up-to-date and accurate. This paper provides source code, test cases, results, and analysis of a version of SGP4 theory designed to be highly compatible with recent DoD versions.},

@article{Huang1998,
abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition' method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions' that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions' yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions' based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.},

abstract = {The GPS instruments on-board the three Earth's Magnetic Field and Environment Explorer (Swarm) satellites provide the opportunity to measure the gravity field model at basin-wide spatial scales. In spite of being a geo-magnetic satellite mission, Swarm's GPS receiver collects highly accurate hl-SST data (van den IJssel et al., 2015), which has been exploited to produce gravity field models at a number of institutes, namely at the Astronomical Institute (ASU) of the Czech Academy of Sciences (Bezdeˇk et al., 2014), the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB, J{\"{a}}ggi et al., 2015) and the Institute of Geodesy (IfG) of the Graz University of Technology (Zehentner et al., 2015). With the help of GRACE gravity field models, which are derived from much more accurate ll-SST data, we investigate the best combination strategy for producing a superior model on the basis of the solutions produced by the three institutes, similarly to the approach taken by the European Gravity Service for Improved Emergency Management project (http://egsiem.eu). We demonstrate that the Swarm-derived gravity field models are able to resolve monthly solutions with 1666km spatial resolutions (roughly up to degree 12). We illustrate how these monthly solutions correlate with GRACE-derived monthly solutions, for the period of 2014 – 2015, as well as indicate which geographical areas are measured more or less accurately.},

abstract = {A method is presented for real-time validation of GNSS measurements of a single receiver, where data from each satellite are independently processed. A geometry-free observation model is used with a reparameterized form of the unknowns to overcome rank deficiency of the model. The ionosphere error and non-constant biases such as multipath are assumed changing relatively smoothly as a function of time. Data validation and detection of errors are based on statistical testing of the observation residuals using the detection-identification-adaptation approach. The method is applicable to any GNSS with any number of frequencies. The performance of validation method was evaluated using multi-frequency data from three GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo) that span 3 days in a test site at Curtin University, Australia. Performance of the method in detection and identification of outliers in code observations, and detection of cycle slips in phase data were examined. Results show that the success rate vary according to precision of observations and their number as well as size of the errors. The method capability is demonstrated when processing four IOV Galileo satellites in a single-point-positioning mode and in another test by comparing its performance with Bernese software in detection of cycle slips in precise point-positioning processing using GPS data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The numerical integration method has been routinely used by major institutions worldwide, for example, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ), to produce global gravitational models from satellite tracking measurements of CHAMP and/or GRACE types. Such Earth's gravitational products have found widest possible multidisciplinary applications in Earth Sciences. The method is essentially implemented by solving the differential equations of the partial derivatives of the orbit of a satellite with respect to the unknown harmonic coefficients under the conditions of zero initial values. From the mathematical and statistical point of view, satellite gravimetry from satellite tracking is essentially the problem of estimating unknown parameters in the Newton's nonlinear differential equations from satellite tracking measurements. We prove that zero initial values for the partial derivatives are incorrect mathematically and not permitted physically. The numerical integration method, as currently implemented and used in mathematics and statistics, chemistry and physics, and satellite gravimetry, is groundless, mathematically and physically. Given the Newton's nonlinear governing differential equations of satellite motion with unknown equation parameters and unknown initial conditions, we develop three methods to derive new local solutions around a nominal reference orbit, which are linked to measurements to estimate the unknown corrections to approximate values of the unknown parameters and the unknown initial conditions. Bearing in mind that satellite orbits can now be tracked almost continuously at unprecedented accuracy, we propose the measurement-based perturbation theory and derive global uniformly convergent solutions to the Newton's nonlinear governing differential equations of satellite motion for the next generation of global gravitational models. Since the solutions are global uniformly convergent, theoretically speaking, they are able to extract smallest possible gravitational signals from modern and future satellite tracking measurements, leading to the production of global high-precision, high-resolution gravitational models. By directly turning the nonlinear differential equations of satellite motion into the nonlinear integral equations, and recognizing the fact that satellite orbits are measured with random errors, we further reformulate the links between satellite tracking measurements and the global uniformly convergent solutions to the Newton's governing differential equations as a condition adjustment model with unknown parameters, or equivalently, the weighted least squares estimation of unknown differential equation parameters with equality constraints, for the reconstruction of global high-precision, high-resolution gravitational models from modern (and future) satellite tracking measurements.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission will provide new measurements of Earth's static and time-variable gravity fields with monthly resolution. The temporal effects due to ocean tides and atmospheric mass redistribution are assumed known and could be removed using current models. In this study we quantify the aliasing effects on monthly mean GRACE gravity estimates due to errors in models for ocean tides and atmosphere and due to ground surface water mass variation. Our results are based on simulations of GRACE recovery of monthly gravity solution complete to degree and order 120 in the presence of the respective model errors and temporal aliasing effects. For ocean tides we find that a model error in S2 causes errors 3 times larger than the measurement noise at n < 15 in the monthly gravity solution. Errors in K1, O1, and M2 can be reduced to below the measurement noise level by monthly averaging. For the atmosphere, model errors alias the solution at the measurement noise level. The errors corrupt recovered coefficients and introduce 30% more error in the global monthly geoid estimates up to maximum degree 120. Assuming daily CDAS-1 data for continental surface water mass redistribution, the analysis indicates that the daily soil moisture and snow depth variations with respect to their monthly mean produce a systematic error as large as the measurement noise over the continental regions.},

A global optimization method, the particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is employed to obtain the minimal velocity increments for each scheme. With the optimized results, the minimum required velocity increments as well as the mission time are obtained. Results of numerical simulations also indicate that using MGAs is an efficient approach in the capturing mission. The conclusion complies with the analytical result in this paper that a NEA whose velocity relative to the Earth less than 1.8 km/s can be captured by Earth by just one MGA. For other situations, the combination of MGAs and EGAs is better in sense of the required velocity-increments.},

abstract = {The FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC mission which is a joint Taiwan-US mission for meteorological, climatological, ionospheric, and geodetic studies has successfully provided a significant amount of GPS radio occultation (RO) data for better modeling of climate model, forecasting of weather, and monitoring of ionosphere. Owing to the success of the FORMOSAT-3 program, the follow-on FORMOSAT-7 mission is being planned. In the perceivable future, sources for RO mission can be originated from multiple global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) including GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and Beidou as well as several regional navigation satellite systems (RNSSs) and space-based augmentation systems (SBASs). To facilitate the operational capability for weather forecast and space weather monitoring, the FORMOSAT-7 constellation must be designed to ensure a sufficient and uniform distribution in space and time for GNSS/RNSS/SBAS RO events. In addition, it is desired that the RO events in certain region can be maximized to account for severe weather. As the distribution of RO events due to GNSS, RNSS, and SBAS are distinct and the requirements appear to be multi-objective, the constellation design becomes very complicated. The paper applies genetic algorithm (GA) to design constellation parameters. It is shown that the adopted approach can be used to account for non-uniform distribution of RO events due to RNSSs and SBASs. The GA-based design approach is demonstrated to result in constellations that are superior in both global distribution and regional emphasis of RO events to those of the existing baseline design. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Monthly mass variations within the Earth system produce temporal gravity changes, which are observable by the NASA/GFZ Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin-satellite system. Mass load changes with spatial scales larger than 1000 km have been observed using conventional filters based on a Gaussian smoother, which applies a weight to GRACE spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients depending only on SH degree. This practice is consistent with a degree-dependent error model for GRACE monthly geopotential solutions. The Gaussian filters effectively dampen all power of ill-determined higher-degree components in the estimates. However, the spatial sampling provided by GRACE yields errors that vary with both SH degree and order. The consequence is that maps of spatial loads shall not be smoothed with an isotropic (degree-only) filter, but shall be constructed using anisotropic smoothing thus also yielding better spatial resolution in latitude. We have developed a non-isotropic filter to optimize the smoothing of GRACE temporal gravity observations by considering the degree- and order-dependent quality of GRACE estimates, the latter analysed from the correlation with the predicted signals of hydrologic and ocean models. In order to retain GRACE coefficients in the filtering process that show reasonable correlation with the geophysical (hydrology and ocean) models, we applied Gaussian-type smoothing but with averaging radius depending on the order of the geopotential coefficient estimates. Applied to 2 yr of GRACE data, we showed that the resulting non-isotropic filter yields enhanced GRACE signals with significantly higher resolution in latitude and the same resolution in longitude without reducing the accuracy as compared to the conventional Gaussian smoother.},

abstract = {Optical observations constitute a source of angular measurements of a satellite pass. Commonly, these observations have short durations with respect to the satellite orbit period. As a consequence, the use of classical orbit determination algorithms, as Laplace, Gauss or Escobal methods, give very poor results. The present work faces with the problem of estimating the orbital parameters of an orbiting object using its optical streak acquired by a telescope or a high accuracy camera. In the paper a new technique is developed for the Initial Orbit Determination from optical data by exploiting the genetic algorithms. The algorithm works without restrictions on the observer location. A recent challenging problem is the Initial Orbit Determination with space-based observations. This work focuses on the problem of determinating the orbital parameters of a satellite from an orbiting observer in LEO, using short time observations. We present the results based on a simulation with the observer on a sun-synchronous orbit with a single observation of just 60 s. Monte Carlo simulations are presented with different levels of sensor accuracy to show the reliability of the algorithm. The algorithm is able to yield a candidate solution for each observation. The coplanar case is analyzed and discussed as well. ?? 2013 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The magnetic field mission Swarm, expected to be launched in 2012, comprises a constellation of three satellites. As all of them are equipped with GPS receivers and accelerometers, they can be used for gravity field recovery. We study the capability of a Swarm-like constellation for (time-variable) gravity field recovery and compare it with a gravity field tandem mission of GRACE-type. Due to the lower accuracy of the GPS measurements compared with GRACE low–low satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST), the accuracy of a Swarm derived gravity field cannot compete with the state-of-the-art GRACE models. However, unlike the GRACE mission, Swarm allows for the derivation of GPS-baselines between the satellites in directions other than purely along-track. This makes Swarm an interesting case for studying the error structure of gravity field models derived from various constellation geometries. Therefore, one focus of this study is the general analysis of different baseline constellations independent of the observation accuracy, that is, we do not restrict ourselves to just the actual Swarm case of pure GPS-baselines. To make the results comparable to GRACE, we explicitly study the error behaviour of the different Swarm baseline geometries assuming GRACE-type K-band ranging (KBR) links. This gives an indication of candidate constellations for future missions; at least in regards to the general error structure. To study the potential of Swarm for recovering time-variable components of the gravity field, we have set up a 2-yr simulation to recover annual and semi-annual components of continental hydrology. We show that Swarm has the potential to recover the annual signal up to spherical harmonic degree 6. This is of interest should there be a gap between the end of the GRACE mission and the launch of a follow-on mission. All our simulations make use of the energy integral method. This method is usually (implicitly) formulated for static potential fields. Therefore, it is necessary for our study to investigate the properties of this method when applied to the analysis of time-variable fields.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelbergGlobal and local positioning systems (LPS) make use of nonlinear equations systems to calculate coordinates of unknown points. There exist several methods, such as Sturmfels' resultant, Groebner bases and least squares, for dealing with this kind of equations. We introduce two methods for solving this problem with the aid of symbolic techniques relying on closed-form solutions for the solution set of a system of linear equations. We suppose the receiver just detects or chooses minimal data, i.e., four satellites in global positioning systems (GPS) or three stations in LPS. Both methods proceed by parameterizing the line joining two solution points to later solve a nonlinear univariate equation, either quadratic or with degree smaller than 6. The first one uses the Generalized Cramer Identities, which is a different presentation of the generalized Moore–Penrose inverse, and ends with a degree 6 univariate equation for GPS and a degree 4 univariate equation for LPS. The second one solves the system by dealing with a more geometric way, ending with a quadratic equation. Our approach covers all possible cases with a finite number of solutions, while Bancroft's method cannot be applied when the four satellites, taking the clock bias as fourth coordinate, and the origin lay in the same hyperplane of (Formula presented.), and the method by Grafarend and Shan fails when the four satellites are in the same plane in (Formula presented.). The two proposed methods fail only when the pseudorange 4 point problem has infinite solutions.},

abstract = {We examined the sensitivity of estimates of global sea-level rise obtained from GPS-corrected long term tide gauge records to uncertainties in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) realization. A useful transfer function was established, linking potential errors in the reference frame datum (origin and scale) to resulting errors in the estimate of global sea level rise. Contrary to scale errors that are propagated by a factor of 100%, the impact of errors in the origin depends on the network geometry. The geometry of the network analyzed here resulted in an error propagation factor of 50% for the Z component of the origin, mainly due to the asymmetry in the distribution of the stations between hemispheres. This factor decreased from 50% to less than 10% as the geometry of the network improved using realistic potential stations that did not yet meet the selection criteria (e.g., record length, data availability). Conversely, we explored new constraints on the reference frame by considering forward calculations involving tide gauge records. A reference frame could be found in which the scatter of the regional sea-level rates was limited. The resulting reference frame drifted by 1.36 0.22 mm/year from the ITRF2000 origin in the Z component and by ??0.44 0.22mm/year from the ITRF2005 origin. A bound on the rate of global sea level rise of 1.2 to 1.6mm/year was derived for the past century, depending on the origin of the adopted reference frame. The upper bound is slightly lower than previous estimates of 1.8mm/year discussed in the IPCC fourth report.},

abstract = {Recent developments in high energy lasers, adaptive optics, and atmospheric transmission bring laser propulsion to realization. Perhaps more important, the need to transport much greater tonnages to orbit for commercial purposes, the space station, and for military purposes is now clear. A part (e.g. half the space station supplies) of this traffic could be orbited in small packages. Accordingly a workshop on this possibility was held at Livermore National Laboratory in July 1986 and this paper leans heavily on its results. This paper proposes a reference vehicle for study which consists of payload and solid propellant (e.g. ice). A suitable laser pulse is proposed for using a Laser Supported Detonation wave to produce thrust efficiently. It seems likely that a minimum system (10 Mw CO2 laser & 10 m dia. mirror) could be constructed for about $150 K. This minimum system could launch payloads of about 13 kg. to a 400 km. orbit every 10 minutes. The annual launch capability would be about 683 tonnes times the duty factor. Laser propulsion would be an order of magnitude cheaper than chemical rockets if the duty factor was 20% (10,000 launches/yr.) and launches beyond that would be even cheaper. The chief problem which needs to be addressed before these possibilities could be realized is the design of a propellant to turn laser energy into thrust efficiently and to withstand the launch environment.},

abstract = {Atmospheric masses play an important role in precise downward continuation and validation of satellite gravity gradiometry data. In this paper we present two alternative ways to formulate the atmospheric potential. Two density models for the atmosphere are proposed and used to formulate the external and internal atmospheric potentials in spherical harmonics. Based on the derived harmonic coefficients, the direct atmospheric effects on the satellite gravity gradiometry data are investigated and presented in the orbital frame over Fennoscandia. The formulas of the indirect atmospheric effects on gravity anomaly and geoid (downward continued quantities) are also derived using the proposed density models. The numerical results show that the atmospheric effect can only be significant for precise validation or inversion of the GOCE gradiometric data at the mE level. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigate how uncertainties in seismic and density structure of the crust propagate to uncertainties in mantle density structure. The analysis is based on interpretation of residual upper-mantle gravity anomalies which are calculated by subtracting (stripping) the gravitational effect of the crust from the observed satellite gravity field data (GOCE Direct release 3). Thus calculated residual mantle gravity anomalies are caused mainly by a heterogeneous density distribution in the upper mantle. Given a relatively small range of expected compositional density variations in the lithospheric mantle, knowledge on uncertainties associated with incomplete information on crustal structure is of utmost importance for progress in gravity modelling. Uncertainties in the residual upper-mantle gravity anomalies result chiefly from uncertainties in (i) seismic VP velocity-density conversion for the crust and (ii) uncertainties in the seismic crustal structure (thickness and average VP velocities of individual crustal layers, including the sedimentary cover). We examine the propagation of these uncertainties into determinations of lithospheric mantle density and analyse both sources of possible uncertainties by applying different velocity-to-density conversions and by introducing variations into the crustal structurewhich correspond to typical resolution of high-quality and low-quality seismic models. We apply our analysis to Siberia (the West Siberian Basin and the Siberian Craton) for which a new regional seismic crustal model, SibCrust, has recently become available. For the same region, we also compute upper-mantle gravity and density anomalies based on three global crustal models (CRUST 5.1, CRUST 2.0 and CRUST 1.0) and compare the results based on four different crustal models. A large uncertainty in the VP-to-density conversion may result in the uncertainty in lithospheric mantle density anomalies of ca. 0.02-0.03 g cm-3 (i.e. 0.5-1 per cent, which is comparable to compositional density anomalies expected for continental lithosphere mantle). Similar values of uncertainties may be caused by a 0.2 km s-1 error in average crustal VP velocities or by a 2 kmuncertainty in theMoho depth. One of the largest uncertainties is caused by errors in thickness of the sedimentary layer, and a 2 km error leads to ca. 0.03 g cm-3 error in lithospheric mantle densities. Large deviations (locally ±10 km) of the Moho depth in global crustal models (CRUST 5.1, CRUST2.0 and CRUST1.0) from the high-resolution regional seismic model of the crust, SibCrust, may produce artefact residual mantle gravity anomalies of up to ±150 mGal locally, caused by large errors in crustal gravity corrections. These errors in gravity anomalies produce up to ca. 0.04 g cm-3 (ca. 1.2 per cent) errors in density of the lithospheric mantle, which may well correspond to the amplitude of real density anomalies in the mantle. Our results demonstrate that gravity modelling alone cannot reliably constrain the crustal structure, including the Moho depth and thickness of sediments.},

abstract = {The gravity anomalies at sea level can be used to validate the satellite gravity gradiometry data. Validation of such a data is important prior to downward continuation because of amplification of the data errors through this process. In this paper the second-order radial derivative of the extended Stokes' formula is employed and the emphasis is on least-squares modification of this formula to generate the second-order radial gradient at satellite level. Two methods in this respect are proposed: (a) modifying the second-order radial derivative of extended Stokes' formula directly, and (b) modifying extended Stokes' formula prior to taking the second-order radial derivative. Numerical studies show that the former method works well but the latter is very sensitive to the proper choice of the cap size of integration and degree of modification. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the spatial, temporal, and spectral variations between the different gravity field products and developed an ensemble gravity field solution from the products of four such analysis centers. The solutions were found to lie within a certain analysis scatter regardless of the local relative water height variation, and the ensemble model is clearly seen to reduce the noise in the gravity field solutions within the available scatter of the solutions.

abstract = {Results of the sea-level budget in the high latitudes (up to 80{\textdegree}N) and the Arctic Ocean during the satellite altimetry era. We investigate the closure of the sea-level budget since 2002 using two altimetry sea-level datasets based on the Envisat waveform retracking: temperature and salinity data from the ORAP5 reanalysis, and Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) space gravimetry data to estimate the steric and mass components. Regional sea-level trends seen in the altimetry map, in particular over the Beaufort Gyre and along the eastern coast of Greenland, are of halosteric origin. However, in terms of regional average over the region ranging from 66{\textdegree}N to 80{\textdegree}N, the steric component contributes little to the observed sea-level trend, suggesting a dominant mass contribution in the Arctic region. This is confirmed by GRACE-based ocean mass time series that agree well with the altimetry-based sea-level time series. Direct estimate of the mass component is not possible prior to GRACE. Thus, we estimated the mass contribution from the difference between the altimetry-based sea level and the steric component. We also investigate the coastal sea level with tide gauge records. Twenty coupled climate models from the CMIP5 project are also used. The models lead us to the same conclusions concerning the halosteric origin of the trend patterns.},

The simulations presented here suggest that GRACE will be able to monitor non-secular changes in ocean mass on a global basis with a spatial resolution of 500 km and an accuracy of 3 mm water equivalent. It should be possible to recover global mean ocean mass variations to an accuracy of 1 mm, possibly much better if the atmospheric pressure modeling errors can be reduced. We have not considered the possibly significant errors that may arise due to temporal aliasing and secular gravity variations. Secular signals from glacial isostatic adjustment and the melting of polar ice mass are expected to be quite large, and will complicate the recovery of secular ocean mass variations. Nevertheless, GRACE will provide unprecedented insight into the mass components of sea level change, especially when combined with coincident satellite altimeter measurements. Progress on these issues would provide new insight into the response of sea level to climate change.},

abstract = {The radar imaging satellite mission TerraSAR-X requires precisely determined satellite orbits for validating geodetic remote sensing techniques. Since the achieved quality of the operationally derived, reduced-dynamic (RD) orbit solutions limits the capabilities of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) validation, an effort is made to improve the estimated orbit solutions. This paper discusses the benefits of refined dynamical models on orbit accuracy as well as estimated empirical accelerations and compares different dynamic models in a RD orbit determination. Modeling aspects discussed in the paper include the use of a macro-model for drag and radiation pressure computation, the use of high-quality atmospheric density and wind models as well as the benefit of high-fidelity gravity and ocean tide models. The Sun-synchronous dusk--dawn orbit geometry of TerraSAR-X results in a particular high correlation of solar radiation pressure modeling and estimated normal-direction positions. Furthermore, this mission offers a unique suite of independent sensors for orbit validation. Several parameters serve as quality indicators for the estimated satellite orbit solutions. These include the magnitude of the estimated empirical accelerations, satellite laser ranging (SLR) residuals, and SLR-based orbit corrections. Moreover, the radargrammetric distance measurements of the SAR instrument are selected for assessing the quality of the orbit solutions and compared to the SLR analysis. The use of high-fidelity satellite dynamics models in the RD approach is shown to clearly improve the orbit quality compared to simplified models and loosely constrained empirical accelerations. The estimated empirical accelerations are substantially reduced by 30{%} in tangential direction when working with the refined dynamical models. Likewise the SLR residuals are reduced from {$}{$}-3{\},{\}pm {\},17{$}{$} - 3 {\textpm} 17 to {$}{$}2{\},{\}pm {\},13{$}{$} 2 {\textpm} 13 mm, and the SLR-derived normal-direction position corrections are reduced from 15 to 6 mm, obtained from the 2012--2014 period. The radar range bias is reduced from {$}{$}-10.3{$}{$} - 10.3 to {$}{$}-6.1{$}{$} - 6.1 mm with the updated orbit solutions, which coincides with the reduced standard deviation of the SLR residuals. The improvements are mainly driven by the satellite macro-model for the purpose of solar radiation pressure modeling, improved atmospheric density models, and the use of state-of-the-art gravity field models.},

abstract = {The gravity field dedicated satellite missions like CHAMP, GRACE, and GOCE are supposed to map the Earth's global gravity field with unprecedented accuracy and resolution. New models of the Earth's static and time-variable gravity fields will be available every month as one of the science products from GRACE. A method for the efficient gravity field recovery is presented using in situ satellite-to-satellite observations at altitude and results on static as well as temporal gravity field recovery are shown. Considering the energy relationship between the kinetic energy of the satellite and the gravitational potential, the disturbing potential observations can be computed from the orbital state vector, using high-low GPS tracking data, low - low satellite-to-satellite GRACE measurements, and data from 3-axis accelerometers. The solution method is based on the conjugate gradient iterative approach to efficiently recover the gravity field coefficients and approximate error covariance up to degree and order 120 every month. Based on the monthly GRACE noise-only simulation, the geoid was obtained with an accuracy of a few cm and with a resolution half wavelength) of 160 km. However, the geoid accuracy can become worse by a factor of 6 - 7 because of spatial aliasing. The approximate error covariance was found to be a very good accuracy measure of the estimated coefficients, geoid, and gravity anomaly. The temporal gravity field, representing the monthly mean continental water mass redistribution, was recovered in the presence of measurement noise and high frequency temporal variation. The resulting recovered temporal gravity fields have about 0.3 mm errors in terms of geoid height with a resolution of 670 km.},

abstract = {We numerically investigate the impact of GTR on the orbital part of the satellite-to-satellite range rho and range-rate dotrho of the twin GRACE A/B spacecrafts through their dynamical equations of motion integrated in an Earth-centered frame over a time span Delta t=1 d. Instead, the GTR effects connected with the propagation of the electromagnetic waves linking the spacecrafts are neglected. The present-day accuracies in measuring the GRACE biased range and range-rate are sigmarhosim 1-10 mum, sigmadotrhosim 0.1-1 mum s -1; studies for a follow-on of such a mission points toward a range-rate accuracy of the order of sigmadotrhosim 1 nm s -1 or better. The GTR range and range-rate effects turn out to be Deltarho=80 mum and Deltadotrho=0.012 mum s -1 (Lense-Thirring), and Deltarho=6000 mum and Deltadotrho=10 mum s -1 (Schwarzschild). We also compute the dynamical range and range-rate perturbations caused by the first six zonal harmonic coefficients JL, L=2,3,4,5,6,7 of the classical multipolar expansion of the terrestrial gravitational potential in order to evaluate their aliasing impact on the relativistic effects. Conversely, we also quantitatively, and preliminarily, assess the possible a-priori virgimprinting of GTR itself, not solved-for in all the GRACE-based Earth's gravity models produced so far, on the estimated values of the low degree zonals of the geopotential. The present sensitivity analysis can also be extended, in principle, to different orbital configurations in order to design a suitable dedicated mission able to accurately measure the relativistic effects considered.},

abstract = {Most studies using GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data for examining water storage anomalies have rich hydrogeological databases. Here, GRACE data are analyzed for southern Mali, Africa, a region with sparse hydrogeological data. GRACE data (2002-2008) did not overlap with observed groundwater-level data (1982-2002). Terrestrial water storage from GRACE was corrected for soil moisture using the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model to obtain monthly groundwater storage anomalies and annual net recharge. Historical storage anomalies and net recharge were determined using the water-table fluctuation method for available observation wells. Average annual net recharge averaged 149.1 mm (or 16.4% of annual rainfall) and 149.7 mm (14.8%) from historical water level and GRACE data, respectively. Monthly storage anomaly lows and peaks were observed in May and September, respectively, but have a shift in peak to November using the corrected GRACE data, suggesting that the GLDAS model may poorly predict the timing of soil-water storage in this region. Notwithstanding problems with the GLDAS model, the soil moisture-corrected GRACE data accurately predict the relative timing and magnitude of groundwater-storage changes, suggesting that GRACE data are valuable for identifying long-term regional changes in groundwater storage in areas with sparse hydrogeological data.},

However, signals can be considered as being composed of sinusoids which possess amplitudes, frequencies and phases. All these three attributes can be computed at each point in time, and then used as the basis of a cross-correlation method. By using all the three measures of correlation together, their individual disadvantages can be minimised. By combining these measures with the continuous wavelet transform, information on the correlation as a function of wavelength can be obtained.},

@article{Vey2013,
abstract = {Our study analyses satellite and land-based observations of the Yakutsk region centred at the Lena watershed, an area characterised mainly by continuous permafrost. Using monthly solutions of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment satellite mission, we detect a mass increase over central Siberia from 2002 to 2007 which reverses into a mass decrease between 2007 and 2011. No significant mass trend is visible for the whole observation period. To further quantify this behaviour, different mass signal components are studied in detail: (1) inter-annual variation in the atmospheric mass, (2) a possible effect of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), and (3) hydrological mass variations. In standard processing the atmospheric mass signal is reduced based on the data from numerical weather prediction models. We use surface pressure observations in order to validate this atmospheric reduction. On inter-annual time scale the difference between the atmospheric mass signal from model prediction and from surface pressure observation is << 4 mm in equivalent water height. The effect of GIA on the mass signal over Siberia is calculated using a global ice model and a spherically symmetric, compressible, Maxwell-viscoelastic earth model. The calculation shows that for the investigated area any effect of GIA can be ruled out. Hence, the main part of the signal can be attributed to hydrological mass variations. We briefly discuss potential hydrological effects such as changes in precipitation, river discharge, surface and subsurface water storage.},

@article{Horwath2012,
abstract = {Interannual variations of the Antarctic ice sheet due to surface mass balance (SMB) fluctuations are important for mass balance estimates and interpretations. To date, these variations are primarily assessed by global or regional atmospheric modelling. Satellite altimetry and satellite gravimetry over the ice sheet provide complementary observations of the related volume and mass effects, respectively. Yet, so far the interannual signal contents of these observations have not been extensively studied. We compare and jointly interpret ENVISAT radar altimetry (RA) and GRACE satellite gravimetry results, relying on RA products from the along-track repeat satellite RA approach and on the GRACE 10-d solutions by CNES/GRGS. RA results and GRACE results are expressed in terms of variations of ice sheet thickness, $\Delta$z(t), and ice-equivalent thickness, $\Delta$zice(t), respectively. In view of the different errors and limitations of both techniques and of differences between $\Delta$z(t) and $\Delta$zice(t) expected due to firn-related processes, our principal approach is a comparison of qualitative patterns in space and time. To adjust the spatial resolution of both data sets, we describe the spatial filtering inherent to the regularization of the CNES/GRGS GRACE solutions and apply this filtering to the ENVISAT RA height changes in a consistent fashion. After correction for glacial isostatic adjustment, the spatial patterns of linear trends seen by ENVISAT RA and GRACE over the period 2002 October to 2009 August agree well, not only for the extreme ice losses in the West Antarctic Amundsen Sea Sector but also for an alternating sequence of gains and losses along the East Antarctic coast. Our main focus is on interannual signals, which we represent by the low-pass filtered non-linear, non-seasonal components of the $\Delta$z(t) and $\Delta$zice(t) time-series. These components should reflect interannual SMB variations, apart from effects of changes in ice flow. We find an agreement between the interannual variation patterns from ENVISAT RA and GRACE with temporal correlation coefficients typically in the order of 0.8. This qualitative agreement, prevailing even in the theoretical absence of a simple proportionality between $\Delta$z(t) and $\Delta$zice(t), indicates that both observational signals primarily originate in common geophysical variations. Combining both geodetic data sets aids their interpretation and promises to be valuable for the reduction of SMB uncertainties. In a case study based on the analysis of both GRACE and ENVISAT RA, we identify a prominent interannual feature in West Antarctica in 2005 September/October as an event of excess snow accumulation with a mass effect of 82 ± 31 Gt.},

abstract = {Purpose of this article is to demonstrate the effect of background\ngeophysical corrections on a follow-on gravity mission. We investigate\nthe quality of two effects, tides and atmospheric pressure variations,\nwhich both act as a surface load on the lithosphere. In both cases\ndirect gravitational attraction of the mass variations and the secondary\npotential caused by the deformation of the lithosphere are sensed\nby a gravity mission. In order to assess the current situation we\nhave simulated GRACE range-rate errors which are caused by differences\nin present day tide and atmospheric pressure correction models.\nBoth geophysical correction models are capable of generating range-rate\nerrors up to 10 ?m/s and affect the quality of the recovered temporal\nand static gravity fields. Unlike missions such as TOPEX/Poseidon\nwhere tides can be estimated with the altimeter, current gravity\nmissions are only to some degree capable of resolving these (geo)physical\nlimitations. One of the reasons is the use of high inclination low\nearth orbits without a repeating ground track strategy. The consequence\nis that we will face a contamination of the gravity solution, both\nin the static and the time variable part. In the conclusions of\nthis paper we provide suggestions for improving this situation,\nin particular in view of follow-on gravity missions after GRACE\nand GOCE, which claim an improved capability of estimating temporal\nvariations in the Earth�s gravity field.},

abstract = {We develop a new approach for cycle slip detection and repair under high ionospheric activity using undifferenced dual-frequency GPS carrier phase observations. A forward and backward moving window averaging (FBMWA) algorithm and a second-order, time-difference phase ionospheric residual (STPIR) algorithm are integrated to jointly detect and repair cycle slips. The FBMWA algorithm is proposed to detect cycle slips from the widelane ambiguity of Melbourne–W{\"{u}}bbena linear combination observable. The FBMWA algorithm has the advantage of reducing the noise level of widelane ambiguities, even if the GPS data are observed under rapid ionospheric variations. Thus, the detection of slips of one cycle becomes possible. The STPIR algorithm can better remove the trend component of ionospheric variations compared to the normally used first-order, time-difference phase ionospheric residual method. The combination of STPIR and FBMWA algorithms can uniquely determine the cycle slips at both GPS L 1 and L 2 frequencies. The proposed approach has been tested using data collected under different levels of ionospheric activities with simulated cycle slips. The results indicate that this approach is effective even under active ionospheric conditions.},

@article{Sprlak2016,
abstract = {In this study we assume that a gravitational curvature tensor, i.e. a tensor of third-order directional derivatives of the Earth's gravitational potential, is observable at satellite altitudes. Such a tensor is composed of ten different components, i.e. gravitational curvatures, which may be combined into vertical--vertical--vertical, vertical--vertical--horizontal, vertical--horizontal--horizontal and horizontal--horizontal-horizontal gravitational curvatures. Firstly, we study spectral properties of the gravitational curvatures. Secondly, we derive new quadrature formulas for the spherical harmonic analysis of the four gravitational curvatures and provide their corresponding analytical error models. Thirdly, requirements for an instrument that would eventually observe gravitational curvatures by differential accelerometry are investigated. The results reveal that measuring third-order directional derivatives of the gravitational potential imposes very high requirements on the accuracy of deployed accelerometers which are beyond the limits of currently available sensors. For example, for orbital parameters and performance similar to those of the GOCE mission, observing third-order directional derivatives requires accelerometers with the noise level of {$}{$}{{}{\}sim{}}10^{{}-17{}}{\},{\}hbox {{}m{}}{\},{\}hbox {{}s{}}^{{}-2{}}{$}{$} ∼ 10 - 17 m s - 2 Hz {$}{$}^{{}-1/2{}}{$}{$} - 1 / 2 .},

abstract = {The exploitation of altimetric data sets from past and current satellite missions is crucial to both oceanographic and geodetic applications, since it allows the determination of sea level anomalies as deviations from a static mean sea level, while it is also fundamental for marine geoid determination. In this work, altimetric data sets from the satellite missions of JASON1 and ENVISAT have been used towards the determination of Mean Sea Surface (MSS) models in the Mediterranean Sea. The raw data used are Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) values and their total inverse barometer corrections from the respective altimetric missions. Along-track records of the SLA have been first used to derive linear trends of the SLA variation in the area under study and then determine empirical covariance functions to estimate single and multi-satellite models of the mean sea surface through least squares collocation. The latter is then employed along with the GOCE/GRACE GOCO02s GGM in order to estimate the dynamic ocean topography (DOT) in the Mediterranean Sea and consequently the steady-state circulation in the area. The resulting initial DOT estimates are treated through various filters in order to remove high-frequency information that results from computing the residuals between the high-resolution MSS and the lower resolution GOCE geoid heights (degree and order 250 corresponding to $\sim$80 km). To this respect three types of filters are used, namely boxcar, Gaussian and Wiener ones employing various spatial wavelengths for the filter width to accommodate their cut-off frequency. The finally derived solutions presented refer to filters with spatial wavelengths set to 150 km and 200 km (75 km and 100 half-wavelength, respectively), which are used to determine the steady-state circulation in the Mediterranean Sea. The results are validated against the RioMed model for the DOT, the DTU2010 DOT and a solution based on the DTU2010 MSS and GOCO02s.},

This new release of the CNES/GRGS GRACE gravity solution, named "Release 3" or "RL03", features in addition to using the L-1BV2 data: - an improved a priori gravity model, closely following the actual gravity variations already observed by GRACE, - the use of FES2012 tide model in replacement of FES2004, - the use of the atmospheric dealiasing fields ECMWF ERA-interim (every 3 hours) in replacement of ECMWF operational model (every 6 hours), - the use of the oceanic dealiasing fields TUGO (every 3 hours) in replacement of MOG2D (every 6 hours), - some changes in the K-Band ranging and accelerometer parameterization, - an inversion procedure using truncated Eigen values allowing, as was the case for RL02, a direct interpretation of the gravity solutions without the need for additional filtering, - an extension of the maximal degree of the time-variable parameters from 50 to 80. The CNES/GRGS RL03 solutions will be compared with the RL05 solutions from the other groups at the 10-day and at the monthly time scale.},

abstract = {In this paper we review and update detection and attribution studies in sea level and its major contributors during the past decades. Tide gauge records reveal that the observed twentieth-century global and regional sea level rise is out of the bounds of its natural variability, evidencing thus a human fingerprint in the reported trends. The signal varies regionally, and it partly depends on the magnitude of the background variability. The human fingerprint is also manifested in the contributors of sea level for which observations are available, namely ocean thermal expansion and glaciers{\^{a}}   mass loss, which dominated the global sea level rise over the twentieth century. Attribution studies provide evidence that the trends in both components are clearly dominated by anthropogenic forcing over the second half of the twentieth century. In the earlier decades, there is a lack of observations hampering an improved attribution of causes to the observed sea level rise. At certain locations along the coast, the human influence is exacerbated by local coastal activities that induce land subsidence and increase the risk of sea level-related hazards.},

abstract = {The GGM05 model suite consists of three mean Earth gravity field models. GGM05S1 was derived using only GRACE data (Tapley et al. 2013), and GGM05G2 is derived from GRACE and GOCE data (Bettadpur et al., 2015). GGM05C, described in this document, combines GRACE, GOCE and terrestrial gravity data. The GGM05C gravity model was estimated to spherical harmonic degree and order 360 from a combination of GRACE and GOCE gravity information (based on GGM05G) and surface gravity anomalies from DTU13 (Andersen et al., 2014). The 2 minute resolution anomalies were used, assuming that they were classical gravity anomalies (i.e., defined on the ellipsoid). The first step was a low pass filter applied to the DTU13 global anomaly field using the Driscoll and Healy algorithm (Driscoll and Healy, 1994). This was followed by a spherical harmonic analysis of the gravity anomaly set on the ellipsoid, where the coefficients were analytically transformed following the approach described in Claessens (2005). This was taken to degree 540, but only the coefficients up to degree 360 were used. Rather than reprocess the surface gravity data, the full covariance from GGM03C (Tapley et al., 2007) was adopted as apriori. The covariance was then modified so that, below degree 240, the terrestrial information was severely downweighted in order to preserve the accuracy of the GRACE and GOCE gravity contribution. This artificial covariance was used to combine the surface gravity information with GGM05G to obtain the GGM05C solution. Figure},

abstract = {The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite aimed at determining the Earth's mean gravity field. GOCE delivered gravity gradients containing directional information, which are complicated to use because of their error characteristics and because they are given in a rotating instrument frame indirectly related to the Earth. We compute gravity gradients in grids at 225 km and 255 km altitude above the reference ellipsoid corresponding to the GOCE nominal and lower orbit phases respectively, and find that the grids may contain additional high-frequency content compared with GOCE-based global models. We discuss the gradient sensitivity for crustal depth slices using a 3D lithospheric model of the North-East Atlantic region, which shows that the depth sensitivity differs from gradient to gradient. In addition, the relative signal power for the individual gradient component changes comparing the 225 km and 255 km grids, implying that using all components at different heights reduces parameter uncertainties in geophysical modelling. Furthermore, since gravity gradients contain complementary information to gravity, we foresee the use of the grids in a wide range of applications from lithospheric modelling to studies on dynamic topography, and glacial isostatic adjustment, to bedrock geometry determination under ice sheets.},

abstract = {In an attempt to model regular variations of the ionosphere, the least-squares harmonic estimation is applied to the time series of the total electron contents (TEC) provided by the JPL analysis center. Multivariate and modulated harmonic estimation spectra are introduced and estimated for the series to detect the regular and modulated dominant frequencies of the periodic patterns. Two significant periodic patterns are the diurnal and annual signals with periods of 24/ n hours and 365.25/ n days ( n = 1, 2, {\ldots}), which are the Fourier series decomposition of the regular daily and yearly periodic variations of the ionosphere. The spectrum shows a cluster of periods near 27 days, thereby indicating irregularities at this solar cycle period. A series of peaks, with periods close to the diurnal signal and its harmonics, are evident in the spectrum. In fact, the daily signal harmonics of $\omega$ i = 2$\pi$ i are modulated with the annual signal harmonics of $\omega$ j = 2$\pi$ j /365.25 as $\omega$ ijM = 2$\pi$ i (1 ± j /365.25 i ). Among them, at low and midlatitudes, the largest variations belong to the diurnal signal modulated to the semiannual signal. Some preliminary results on the modulated part are presented. The maximum ranges of the modulated daily signal are ±15 TECU and ±6 TECU at high and low solar periods, respectively. A model consisting of purely harmonic functions plus modulated ones is capable of studying known regular anomalies of the ionosphere, which is currently in progress.},

The accuracy of force models acting on satellite can be improved with the onboard accelerometer, and which then increased the accuracy and reliability of orbit determined by the reduced dynamic method. Several corrections have been adopted to increase the precision of GPS un-differenced measurements, which along with the high precision KBR measurements ensured the high precision of orbit determination. The paper established the state function of the formation flying spacecrafts and three types of measurement functions of the orbit filter model. The computation results based on GRACE satellite experiment data shows that the r.m.s of three axis of orbit is better than 20cm and the velocity is on the level of mm/s},

@article{Klokocnik2015,
abstract = {One of the limiting factors in the determination of global gravity field parameters is the spatial sampling, namely during phases when the satellite is in an orbit with few revolutions for each repeat cycle. This often happens when it is freely passing (drifting) through the atmosphere and encountering a fair number of such deficient repeat orbits. This research was triggered in 2004 by the significant but only temporary, 2-3 months long, decrease of the accuracy of monthly solutions for the gravity field variations derived from GRACE. The reason for the dip was the 61/4 resonance in the GRACE orbits in autumn 2004. At this resonance, the ground track density dramatically decreased and large (mainly longitude) gaps appeared in the data-coverage of the globe. The problem of spatial sampling has been studied repeatedly (Wagner et al., 2006; Kloko{\v{c}}n{\'{i}}k et al., 2008; Weigelt et al., 2009) and simple rules have been derived to limit the maximum order for unconstrained solutions (inversions) for the gravity field parameters or their variations from observations of a single satellite. Here we work with the latest rule from Weigelt et al. (2013) which distinguishes the maximum attainable order according to the parity of the two parameters defining the repeat orbit or orbital resonance, $\beta$ the number of nodal satellite's revolutions in $\alpha$ nodal days ($\alpha$, $\beta$ co-prime integers, the ratio $\beta$/$\alpha$ irreducible). This rule, that the resolvable order (in a repeat near polar orbit) should be $\beta$ for odd parity ($\beta$ - $\alpha$) and $\beta$/2 for even parity ($\beta$ - $\alpha$) orbits, arose from the discovery that the number of distinct and equally spaced equatorial crossings (ascending and descending passes) for odd parity ($\beta$ - $\alpha$) is 2$\beta$ while for even parity orbits it is only $\beta$. We extend this insight over all achievable latitudes and assess the ground track density (or coverage) by way of the maximum distances between subsatellite points at arbitrary latitude, specifically for the nearly polar (drifting) orbits of CHAMP, GRACE, and the repeat tuned GOCE. We demonstrate clearly how latitude (and also the orbital inclination) is important and affects the choice of an order resolution limit. A new rule, compromising between $\beta$ and $\beta$/2 for each specific repeat orbit, is proposed, based on the average maximum distance between subsatellite points over the achievable latitudes. Although these findings allow an initial estimate of recoverability based solely on the global spatial sampling of the ground track, a more refined analysis involving the inversion of specific observations is still outstanding.},

A Taylor-series integration reentry integrator is developed and compared with the fifth-order Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg integrator to determine whether Taylor-series integration is faster than traditional integration methods for reentry applications. By comparing the central processing unit times of the integrators, Taylor-series integration is indeed found to be faster for integration without wind and slower with wind, unless the error tolerance is 10−8 or lower. Furthermore, it is found that reducing step sizes to prevent integration over discontinuities is not only needed for Taylor-series integration to obtain maximum accuracy but also for Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg methods. In that case, the Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg integrator does become several times slower than Taylor-series integration.},

abstract = {In this work we assess the most recent estimates of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) for Antarctica, including those from both forward and inverse methods. The assessment is based on a comparison of the estimated uplift rates with a set of elastic-corrected GPS vertical velocities. These have been observed from an extensive GPS network and computed using data over the period 2009–2014. We find systematic underestimations of the observed uplift rates in both inverse and forward methods over specific regions of Antarctica characterized by low mantle viscosities and thin lithosphere, such as the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the Amundsen Sea Embayment, where its recent ice discharge history is likely to be playing a role in current GIA. Uplift estimates for regions where many GIA models have traditionally placed their uplift maxima, such as the margins of Filchner-Ronne and Ross ice shelves, are found to be overestimated. GIA estimates show large variability over the interior of East Antarctica which results in increased uncertainties on the ice-sheet mass balance derived from gravimetry methods.},

abstract = {A very efficient approach for computing spherical harmonic coefficients from satellite gravity gradiometry (SGG) data has been developed. The core of the proposed approach is a combination of the method of conjugate gradients with preconditioning on the one hand and an extremely fast algorithm for synthesis (application of the design matrix to a vector) and co-synthesis (application of the transposed design matrix to a vector) on the other. The high performance of the synthesis and co-synthesis is achieved by introducing an intermediate step, where computations are made on a regular three-dimensional (3-D) spherical grid. As a result, the Legendre functions can be computed for all the points at a given latitude only once and 1-D fast-Fourier techniques can be fully exploited. Transition to the true observation points is carried out by means of a 3-D spline interpolation. It is expected that the technique will be able to invert the full set of SGG data from the GOCE satellite mission (12-month data, four tensor components, 1-s sampling) in only a few hours on an SGI Origin 3800 computer with 16 processing elements. This corresponds approximately to 1 or 2 days of computation on a Pentium-IV PC. The choice of a relatively coarse 3-D spherical grid improves the efficiency even further, at the cost of minor errors in the solution. In this mode, the proposed approach can be used for quick-look data analysis.},

abstract = {The Hatch--Melbourne--W{{\"{u}}}bbena (HMW) combination is a geometry-free and ionospheric-free (first-order) function that has been widely used for cycle slip detection and ambiguity resolution in GNSS dual-frequency data processing. We investigate the characteristics of HMW combinations for BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS) observations for different types of satellites. We first study the characteristics of BDS undifferenced (UD) HMW combinations. Obvious systematic errors are found on BDS UD HMW combinations. The characteristics of single-differenced (SD) and double-differenced (DD) HMW combinations are then analyzed. The results indicate that the biases do not cancel in single-differencing between two satellites. On the contrary, they are amplified because of the superposition of the systematic biases of two satellite signals. In single-differencing between two receivers, different characteristics are found for different satellites types depending on baseline length. For inclined geostationary orbit (IGSO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), the systematic biases cancel for single-differencing between receivers or double-differencing over short and medium baselines; however, they do not cancel in single-differencing between receivers or double-differencing over long baselines. Regarding geostationary earth orbit (GEO), the systematic biases do not cancel for single-differencing between receivers or double-differencing over both short and long baselines. In addition, we analyze the sources of the systematic biases of the BDS HMW combination. The systematic biases of IGSO and MEO HMW combinations mainly originate from multipath errors at the satellite; the systematic biases of GEO HMW combinations may also originate from multipath errors. Finally, we study the influence of the systematic errors on wide-lane ambiguity resolution by analyzing the consistency of the fractional part of the averaged SD HMW combinations and the fixing rate of DD wide-lane ambiguity resolution. The results are compared with those of GPS.},

The KBR system and the dual one-way ranging (DOWR) system employed in KBR is described. Then, effects of oscillator phase noise on KBR ranging precision are analysed theoretically in terms of both time domain and frequency domain. After that, power law noise model of phase noise is presented. Based on the power law noise model, time domain sequences of phase noise are simulated adopting a discrete fractional integration generation method. Finally, the simulated phase noise sequences are injected into the KBR system and the ranging error due to oscillator phase noise is obtained. The final ranging error of this time-domain simulation is verified by comparing its power spectral density (PSD) with the foregoing theoretical frequency domain analysis result.},

abstract = {Lakes are integrators of environmental change occurring at both the regional and global scale. They present a wide range of behavior on a variety of timescales (cyclic and secular) depending on their morphology and climate conditions. Lakes play a crucial role in retaining and stocking water, and because of the significant global environmental changes occurring at several anthropocentric levels, the necessity to monitor all morphodynamic characteristics [e.g., water level, surface (water contour) and volume] has increased substantially. Satellite altimetry and imagery are now widely used together to calculate lake and reservoir water storage changes worldwide. However, strategies and algorithms to calculate these characteristics are not straightforward, and specific approaches need to be developed. We present a review of some of these methodologies by using lakes over the Tibetan Plateau to illustrate some critical aspects and issues (technical and scientific) linked to the observation of climate change impact on surface waters from remote sensing data. Many authors have measured water variation using the limited remote sensing measurements available over short time periods, even though the time series are probably too short to directly link these results with climate change. Indeed, there are many processes and factors, like the influence of lake morphology, that are beyond observation and are still uncertain. The time response for lakes to reach a new state of equilibrium is a key aspect that is often neglected in current literature. Observations over a long period of time, including maintaining a constellation of comprehensive and complementary satellite missions with service continuity over decades, are therefore necessary especially when the ground gauge network is too limited. In addition, the design of future satellite missions with new instrumental concepts (e.g., SAR, SARin, Ka band altimetry, Ka interferometry) will also be suitable for complete monitoring of continental waters.},

abstract = {Over the past three decades, radar altimetry has made a significant contribution to marine gravity field modeling. To improve the accuracy and resolution, we propose a new twin-satellite altimetry. Such a system has several advantages. Among others, it provides (i) twice the number of samples per time epoch, and (ii) information about the cross-track surface gradient with high accuracy because most of the environmental and tidal errors will be common to the simultaneous measurements and therefore cancel out when computing the cross-track gradient computation. We describe a rigorous procedure for the deduction of the sea surface gradient at each altimeter observation point (i.e., not only at the crossovers), from the twin-satellite altimetry system. The precision of the gradient will be slightly affected by orbit errors, instrument drift, and inaccuracies in the geophysical corrections to be applied. We also demonstrate that a 1 mGal accuracy and 1 min resolution marine altimetry gravity field can be obtained if certain conditions are met. To achieve the expected goal, we recommend an orbital configuration, phasing two satellites in 4-s time delay such that the Earth rotation creates a natural baseline between the two satellites, and a 18 kHz SAR altimeter. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

To avoid unexpected discontinuities and to connect pre- and post-maneuver arcs with a minimal set of parameters, a maneuver has to be considered in the routine GPS-based orbit determinations. We propose a maneuver handling method in a reduced-dynamic scheme. With the proper thrust modeling and numerical integration strategy, the effects caused by orbital maneuver can be largely eliminated. The performance for both single-satellite precise orbit determination (POD) and inter-satellite precise baseline determination (PBD) is demonstrated using selected data sets from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. For the POD results, the orbit determination residuals indicate that the orbit with maneuver modeling is well fit to the GPS observations. The external orbit validation shows that the GRACE-B orbits obtained from our approach match the DLR reference orbits better than 3 cm (3D RMS), which is comparable to the result of the maneuver-free GRACE-A satellite. For the PBD results, on average 87 {%} of double-difference phase ambiguities can be resolved to integers and an RMS of the K-band ranging system residuals of better than 0.7 mm can be achieved, even though the orbital maneuver was performed on the spacecraft. Furthermore, the actual maneuver performance derived from the POD and PBD results provides rigorous feedback on the thruster system, which is not only beneficial for current maneuver assessment but also for future maneuver plans.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. The importance of optical time transfer serving as a complement to traditional microwave links, has been attested for GNSSes and for scientific missions. Single photon time transfer (SPTT) is a process, allowing to compare (subtract) time readings of two distant clocks. Such a comparison may be then used to synchronize less accurate clock to a better reference, to perform clock characterization and calibration, to calculate mean time out of ensemble of several clocks, displaced in space. The single-photon time transfer is well established in field of space geodesy, being supported by passive retro-reflectors within space segment of five known GNSSes. A truly two-way, active terminals work aboard of Jason-2 (T2L2)-multiphoton operation, GNSS Beidou (Compass)-SPTT, and are going to be launched within recent ACES project (ELT)-SPTT, and GNSS GLONASS-multiphoton operation. However, there is still missing comprehensive theoretical model of two-way (using satellite receiver and retroreflector) SPTT link incorporating all crucial parameters of receiver (both ground and space segment receivers), transmitter, atmosphere effects on uplink and downlink path, influence of retroreflector. The input to calculation of SPTT link performance will be among others: link budget (distance, power, apertures, beam divergence, attenuation, scattering), propagating medium (atmosphere scintillation, beam wander, etc.), mutual Tx/Rx velocity, wavelength. The SPTT model will be evaluated without the properties of real components. These will be added in the further development. The ground-to-space SPTT link performance of typical scenarios are modeled. This work is a part of the ESA study €Comparison of optical time-transfer links.€},

abstract = {For many years, the gravity field of the Earth was only seen by satellite\ngeodesy as the main factor affecting the orbit and consequently it\nwas retrieved together with a number of other orbital perturbations.\nSince the advent of a new generation of accelerometers, non-gravitational\nperturbations can be separated from the gravity effects and a new\nera of gravity field estimates from space has been born. During preparatory\ndata analysis for new missions performed by the geodetic community,\nthree approaches have been proposed and numerically tested: the brute\nforce method (direct approach), the semi-analytical (time-wise) method\nand the space-wise method. In particular, the time-wise method takes\nadvantage of the incoming time flow of data and, after performing\na Fourier transform of the observation equations, exploits the prevailing\nblock diagonal structure of the normal equations to estimate the\nspherical harmonic coefficients of the gravity field. Complementary\nto this is the space-wise approach, which goes back to the traditional\ncomputation of the harmonic coefficients by an integration technique\nor by least-squares collocation. Some advantages and disadvantages\nare peculiar to both methods, particularly the space-wise approach,\nwhich has for a long time ignored the marked signature of the noise\nspectrum due to the specific measuring conditions of space-borne\naccelerometers. The application of a proper Wiener filter, exploiting\nthe correlation along the orbit, embedded into an iterative scheme,\nseems to be the answer. The solution to this major problem of the\nspace-wise approach is illustrated and simulation results are discussed.\n?� Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {During the decade from mid-2004 to mid-2014 18 great (Mw≥8.0) earthquakes occurred globally ($\sim$1.8 per year), compared to 71 from 1900 to mid-2004 ($\sim$0.68 per year), yielding a short-term rate increase of 265%. Six events had Mw≥8.5, larger than any prior event since the 1965 Rat Islands earthquake. The December 26, 2004 Mw 9.2 Sumatra earthquake had the longest recorded rupture length of 1300+ km and a rupture duration exceeding 450 s. The largest recorded strike-slip earthquake (Mw 8.7) occurred in the Indo-Australian plate on April 11, 2012. The largest recorded deep focus earthquake (Mw 8.3) occurred under the Sea of Okhotsk on May 24, 2013. While this overall surge of activity has not been demonstrated to be causally linked, regional spatio-temporal clustering is clearly evident for great events along the Sumatra, Kuril and Tonga subduction zones, and longer-range interactions have been established for global seismicity and seismic tremor at lower magnitudes following some of the events. This recent decade of intense great earthquake activity coincided with vastly expanded global networks of seismometers, GPS stations, tsunami gauges, and new satellite imaging capabilities such as InSAR and LandSAT interferometry and gravity measurements by GRACE and GOCE, enabling unprecedented analyses of precursory, co-seismic and post-seismic processes around the subduction zone environments where most of the events occurred. Individual events such as the March 11, 2011, Tohoku, Japan Mw 9.0 earthquake produced more ground motion and tsunami recordings than available for all great earthquakes of the last century collectively. Joint inversion and modeling of the diverse data sets exploit complementary sensitivity of the signals to different aspects of the earthquake processes. Major advances have been achieved in quantifying frictional locking and strain accumulation prior to some great events and in relating it to co-seismic slip heterogeneity. Many surprising aspects of these well-quantified great earthquakes have been manifested, associated with their rupture dimensions, tectonic location, compound faulting, triggering interactions, slow slip and foreshock migration precursors, aftershock complexity, and depth-varying seismic radiation characteristics. Regions with potential for near-future great ruptures include mature seismic gaps along the Mentawai Islands and northern Chile, as well as western North America and the Himalayan front, so more great earthquake activity can certainly be anticipated.},

abstract = {NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has already proven to be a powerful data source for regional groundwater assessments in many areas around the world. However, the applicability of GRACE data products to more localized studies and their utility to water management authorities have been constrained by their limited spatial resolution ($\sim$200,000 km2). Researchers have begun to address these shortcomings with data assimilation approaches that integrate GRACE-derived total water storage estimates into complex regional models, producing higher-resolution estimates of hydrologic variables ($\sim$2500 km2). Here we take those approaches one step further by developing an empirically based model capable of downscaling GRACE data to a high-resolution ($\sim$16 km2) dataset of groundwater storage changes over a portion of California's Central Valley. The model utilizes an artificial neural network to generate a series of high-resolution maps of groundwater storage change from 2002 to 2010 using GRACE estimates of variations in total water storage and a series of widely available hydrologic variables (PRISM precipitation and temperature data, digital elevation model (DEM)-derived slope, and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil type). The neural network downscaling model is able to accurately reproduce local groundwater behavior, with acceptable Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values for calibration and validation (ranging from 0.2445 to 0.9577 and 0.0391 to 0.7511, respectively). Ultimately, the model generates maps of local groundwater storage change at a 100-fold higher resolution than GRACE gridded data products without the use of computationally intensive physical models. The model's simulated maps have the potential for application to local groundwater management initiatives in the region.},

Precise orbit determination (POD) and Thermospheric Density and Wind (TDW) chains form part of the Swarm Constellation and Application Facility (SCARF), which will provide the so-called Level 2 products. The POD and TDW chains generate the orbit, accelerometer calibration, and thermospheric density and wind Level 2 products. The POD and TDW chains have been tested with data from the CHAMP and GRACE missions, indicating that a 3D orbit precision of about 10 cm can be reached. In addition, POD allows to determine daily accelerometer bias and scale factor values with a precision of around 10--15 nm/s2 and 0.01--0.02, respectively, for the flight direction. With these accelerometer calibration parameter values, derived thermospheric density is consistent at the 9--11% level (standard deviation) with values predicted by models (taking into account that model values are 20--30% higher). The retrieval of crosswinds forms part of the processing chain, but will be challenging.

abstract = {A train of large amplitude infrasound wave packets was observed by multipoint Continuous Doppler sounding system in the ionosphere over the Czech Republic on 11 March 2011. It is shown that these infrasound wave packets originated from vertical motion of the ground surface that was caused by arrival of seismic waves generated by the strong Tohoku earthquake. The infrasound wave packets were observed in the ionosphere at heights of similar to 210-220 km about 9 min after the detection of corresponding wave packets on the ground, which is consistent with the calculated time for vertically propagating infrasound waves. Absolute values of cross-correlation coefficients between ionospheric and ground measurements are typically higher than 0.9 (for two wave packets similar to 0.98). The individual wave packets recorded on the ground have different observed horizontal velocities and correspond to different types of seismic waves. A comparison of vertical velocities of ground motion with oscillation velocities of air particles in the ionosphere indicates that almost 1/10 of the infrasound energy flux excited at the ground reached the altitudes of similar to 210-220 km for wave periods longer than similar to 30 s.

abstract = {Image data sharpening is a challenging field of remote sensing science, which has become more relevant as high spatial-resolution satellites and superspectral sensors have emerged. Although the spectral property is crucial for mineral mapping, spatial resolution is also important as it allows targeted minerals/rocks to be identified/interpreted in a spatial context. Therefore, improving the spatial context, while keeping the spectral property provided by the superspectral sensor, would bring great benefits for geological/mineralogical mapping especially in arid environments. In this paper, a new concept was tested using superspectral data (ASTER) and high spatial-resolution panchromatic data (WorldView-2) for image fusion. A modified Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based sharpening method, which implements a histogram matching workflow that takes into account the real distribution of values, was employed to test whether the substitution of Principal Components (PC1–PC4) can bring a fused image which is spectrally more accurate. The new approach was compared to those most widely used—PCA sharpening and Gram–Schmidt sharpening (GS), both available in ENVI software (Version 5.2 and lower) as well as to the standard approach—sharpening Landsat 8 multispectral bands (MUL) using its own panchromatic (PAN) band. The visual assessment and the spectral quality indicators proved that the spectral performance of the proposed sharpening approach employing PC1 and PC2 improve the performance of the PCA algorithm, moreover, comparable or better results are achieved compared to the GS method. It was shown that, when using the PC1, the visible-near infrared (VNIR) part of the spectrum was preserved better, however, if the PC2 was used, the short-wave infrared (SWIR) part was preserved better. Furthermore, this approach improved the output spectral quality when fusing image data from different sensors (e.g., ASTER and WorldView-2) while keeping the proper albedo scaling when substituting the second PC.},

First, corresponding differential operators, that relate the disturbing gravitational potential to the six components of the disturbing gradiometric tensor in the spherical local north-oriented frame, are applied to the spherical Abel-Poisson integral equation. This yields six new integral equations for which respective kernel functions are given in both spectral and spatial forms. Second, truncation error formulas for each of the integral transforms are provided in the spectral form. Also expressions for the corresponding truncation error coefficients are derived. Third, practical estimators for evaluation of the disturbing gravitational gradients are formulated, and their correctness and expected accuracy are investigated. Finally, the practical estimators are applied for validation of a sample of the gradiometric data provided by the GOCE satellite mission. Obtained results demonstrate applicability of the new apparatus as an alternative validation method of the satellite gravitational gradients.},

abstract = {The time-wise and space-wise approaches are generally applied to data processing and error analysis for satellite gravimetry missions. But both the approaches, which are based on least-squares collocation, address the whole effect of measurement errors and estimate the resolution of gravity field models mainly from a numerical point of indirect view. Moreover, requirement for higher accuracy and resolution gravity field models could make the computation more difficult, and serious numerical instabilities arise. In order to overcome the problems, this study focuses on constructing a direct relationship between power spectral density of the satellite gravimetry measurements and coefficients of the Earth's gravity potential. Based on two-dimensional Fourier transform, the relationship is analytically concluded. By taking advantage of the analytical expression, it is efficient and distinct for parameter estimation and error analysis of missions. From the relationship and the simulations, it is analytically confirmed that the low-frequency noise affects the gravity field recovery in all degrees for the instance of satellite gradiometer recovery mission. Furthermore, some other results and suggestions are also described.},

abstract = {Two of the most important topics in Sea Level Science are addressed in this paper. One is concerned with the evidence for the apparent acceleration in the rate of global sea level change between the 19th and 20th centuries and, thereby, with the question of whether the 20th century sea\r\nlevel rise was a consequence of an accelerated climate change of anthropogenic origin. An acceleration is indeed observed in both tide gauge and saltmarsh data at different locations around the world, yielding quadratic coefficients ‘c' of order 0.005 mm/year2 , and with the most rapid changes of rate of sea level rise occurring around the end of the 19th century. The second topic\r\nrefers to whether there is evidence that extreme sea levels have increased in recent decades at rates significantly different from those in mean levels. Recent results, which suggest that at most locations rates of change of extreme and mean sea levels are comparable, are presented. In\r\naddition, a short review is given of recent work on extreme sea levels by other authors. This body of work, which is focused primarily on Europe and the Mediterranean, also tends to support mean and extreme sea levels changing at similar rates at most locations},

The gravity changes obtained from GRACE data agreed well with those from dislocation theory in both magnitude and spatial pattern. Positive and negative gravity changes appeared on both sides of the epicenter. The positive signature appeared on the western side, and the peak value was approximately 0.4 microgal (1 microgal = 10(-8) m/s²), whereas on the eastern side, the gravity signature was negative, and the peak value was approximately -1.1 microgal. It demonstrates that deep-focus earthquakes Mw ≤ 8.5 are detectable by GRACE observations. Moreover, the coseismic displacements of 20 Global Positioning System (GPS) stations on the Earth's surface were simulated using an elastic dislocation theory in a spherical earth model, and the results are consistent with the GPS results, especially the near-field results. We also estimated the gravity contributions from the coseismic vertical displacements and density changes, analyzed the proportion of these two gravity change factors (based on an elastic dislocation theory in a spherical earth model) in this deep-focus earthquake. The gravity effect from vertical displacement is four times larger than that caused by density redistribution.},

abstract = {Precise point positioning (PPP) using the Global Positioning System (GPS) is widely recognized as an efficient approach for providing precise positioning services. However, its accuracy and reliability could be significantly degraded by unexpected observation discontinuities and unfavorable tracking geometry which are unavoidable, especially in severe environments such as city canyons. Therefore, in the last decades inertial navigation system (INS) has been integrated to overcome such drawbacks. Recently, multi-Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) were applied to enhance the PPP performance by appropriate usage of the increased number of satellites. We present a new approach to tightly integrate the multi-GNSS PPP and INS together in the observation level. The inter-system bias and inter-frequency bias of multi-GNSS and the hardware errors of INS sensors are estimated to improve the position accuracy and to shorten the convergence time of PPP. In order to demonstrate the impact of multi-GNSS observations and INS data on the derived position, velocity, attitude, and the convergence time of PPP, the new approach is validated through an experimental test with a set of land vehicle data. The results show that the position accuracy can be improved by multi-GNSS and INS significantly, but very little improvement in velocity and attitude is achieved. The position root-mean-square improves from 23.3, 19.8, and 14.9 cm of the GPS PPP/INS tightly coupled integration (TCI) solution to 7.9, 3.3, and 5.1 cm of multi-GNSS PPP/INS TCI in north, east, and up components, respectively. Furthermore, GNSS outages are simulated and their effect on the performance of multi-GNSS PPP/INS TCI is investigated to demonstrate the contribution of the multi-GNSS PPP/INS TCI during GNSS outages. In addition, the convergence test also shows that both multi-GNSS and INS can improve the PPP convergence performance noticeably.},

abstract = {A global ocean tide model (NAO.99b model) representing major 16 constituents with a spatial resolution of 0.5° has been estimated by assimilating about 5 years of TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter data into barotropic hydrodynamical model. The new solution is characterized by reduced errors in shallow waters compared to the other two models recently developed; CSR4.0 model (improved version of Eanes and Bettadpur, 1994) and GOT99.2b model (Ray, 1999), which are demonstrated in comparison with tide gauge data and collinear residual reduction test. This property mainly benefits from fine-scale along-track tidal analysis of TOPEX/POSEIDON data. A high-resolution (1/12°) regional ocean tide model around Japan (NAO.99Jb model) by assimilating both TOPEX/POSEIDON data and 219 coastal tide gauge data is also developed. A comparison with 80 independent coastal tide gauge data shows the better performance of NAO.99Jb model in the coastal region compared with the other global models. Tidal dissipation around Japan has been investigated for M2and K1constituents by using NAO.99Jb model. The result suggests that the tidal energy is mainly dissipated by bottom friction in localized area in shallow seas; the M2ocean tidal energy is mainly dissipated in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea at the mean rate of 155 GW, while the K1energy is mainly dissipated in the Sea of Okhotsk at the mean rate of 89 GW. TOPEX/POSEIDON data, however, detects broadly distributed surface manifestation of M2internal tide, which observationally suggests that the tidal energy is also dissipated by the energy conversion into baroclinic tide.},

An evaluation of the model using independent GPS/leveling heights and Arctic gravity data, and comparisons with existing gravity models, EGM96 and GRIM5C1, and new models, EIGEN1S and TEG4 which include CHAMP data, indicate that OSU02A is commensurate in geoid accuracy and, like other new models, it yields some improvement (10% better fit) in the polar region at wavelengths longer than 800 km.},

We have also jointly determined spherical harmonic solutions for the static and time-variable gravity field of Mars, and the Mars k2 Love numbers, exclusive of the gravity contribution of the atmosphere. Consequently, the retrieved time-varying gravity coefficients and the Love number k2 solely yield seasonal variations in the mass of the polar caps and the solid tides of Mars, respectively. We obtain a Mars Love number k2 of 0.1697 ± 0.0027 (3-$\sigma$). The inclusion of MRO tracking data results in improved seasonal gravity field coefficients C30 and, for the first time, C50. Refinements of the atmospheric model in our orbit determination program have allowed us to monitor the odd zonal harmonic C30 for $\sim$1.5 solar cycles (16 years). This gravity model shows improved correlations with MOLA topography up to 15% larger at higher harmonics (l = 60-80) than previous solutions.},

abstract = {In the course of exploiting spacecraft formations for use in separated interferometry (or other missions), it is possible that the separation distance between vehicles will be on the order of 10 m. The effects of spacecraft charging on the dynamics of very closely spaced formations are investigated. For certain high-Earth orbits, the ambient plasma conditions will conspire to produce significant spacecraft charging in an environment with a plasma Debye length of more than 100 m. For such conditions, it is shown that the potential exists to develop disruptive inter-spacecraft Coulomb forces and torques, with magnitude comparable to candidate formation-keeping thrusters over distances of tens of meters. Because of the unexpectedly large interaction forces, the concept of purposely charging spacecraft to affect formation-keeping Coulomb forces is also explored. Analytic methods are developed that show the existence of static equilibrium formations in Earth orbit using only inter-vehicle coulomb forces for one-, two-, and three-dimensional formations. Such Coulomb formations would be free of the risk of plume contamination due to thrusters firing in close proximity. Figures of merit for the proposed Coulomb control system are calculated in a manner analogous to traditional propulsion systems, and it is shown that required forces can be created with milliwatts of power, can be controlled on a millisecond timescale, and imply specific impulses that can be as high as 1013 seconds.},

abstract = {Different types of present or future satellite data have to be combined by applying appropriate weighting for the determination of the gravity field of the Earth, for instance GPS observations for CHAMP with satellite to satellite tracking for the coming mission GRACE as well as gradiometer measurements for GOCE. In addition, the estimate of the geopotential has to be smoothed or regularized because of the inversion problem. It is proposed to solve these two tasks by Bayesian inference on variance components. The estimates of the variance components are computed by a stochastic estimator of the traces of matrices connected with the inverse of the matrix of normal equations, thus leading to a new method for determining variance components for large linear systems. The posterior density function for the variance components, weighting factors and regularization parameters are given in order to compute the confidence intervals for these quantities. Test computations with simulated gradiometer observations for GOCE and satellite to satellite tracking for GRACE show the validity of the approach.},

abstract = {Atmospheric density accounts for the largest source of error for predicting low-Earth orbiting satellite positions. Relevant applications include catalog maintenance, collision avoidance, and mission design. In this paper we quantify density model errors due to density variability at submodel grid spatial scales. Densities in the 370-450 km height region inferred from accelerometer measurements on CHAMP between 2001 and 2006 are utilized. Results are presented in terms of root-mean-square (RMS) amplitudes of the high-pass-filtered density residuals with respect to the trend. RMS one-sigma amplitudes are found to be on the order of 9% (13%) for low (high) geomagnetic activity and to possess distinct seasonal-latitudinal and local time patterns. The RMS density amplitude patterns suggest a high-latitude (i.e., auroral) wave source for many of the density perturbations, dissipation for most waves poleward of 40° latitude, and a preference for penetration to lower latitudes during nighttime and during higher levels of geomagnetic activity and lower levels of solar activity. An unknown fraction of the density variability may also originate from gravity wave sources in the lower atmosphere. The RMS amplitude distributions provide statistical constraints on gravity wave contributions from all sources and in a modeling or theoretical context also help to constrain mean heating and acceleration rates due to wave dissipation. In the context of density model errors, our results can be used to calculate an orbit prediction and attitude dynamics error budget. Other engineering applications such as thruster throttling requirements for a drag-compensated satellite system are also discussed.},

abstract = {The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), which is being developed for positioning services in and around India, is the latest addition to the global family of satellite-based navigation systems. As IRNSS only shares the L5-frequency with GPS, the European Galileo, and the Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), it has at least at present a limited interoperability with the existing systems. Noting that the L5-frequency capability is under development even for GPS, this contribution assesses the interoperability of the IRNSS L5-signal with the GPS, Galileo, and QZSS L5/E5a-signals for positioning and navigation using real data collected in Perth, Australia. First, the noise characteristic of the IRNSS L5-signal and its comparison with that of the GPS, Galileo, and QZSS L1/E1- and L5/E5a-signals is presented. Then, the L5-observables of combined systems (formed from IRNSS, GPS, Galileo, and QZSS) are assessed for real-time kinematic positioning using the standard LAMBDA method and for instantaneous attitude determination using the constrained LAMBDA method. The results show that the IRNSS L5-signal has comparable noise characteristics as that of the other L5/E5a-signals. For single-frequency carrier phase-based positioning and navigation, the results show better ambiguity resolution performance of L5/E5a-only processing than that of L1/E1-only processing.},

abstract = {In this paper, a stochastic collocation-based Kalman filter (SCKF) is developed to estimate the hydraulic conductivity from direct and indirect measurements. It combines the advantages of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for dynamic data assimilation and the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) for efficient uncertainty quantification. In this approach, the random log hydraulic conductivity field is first parameterized by the Karhunen–Loeve (KL) expansion and the hydraulic pressure is expressed by the PCE. The coefficients of PCE are solved with a collocation technique. Realizations are constructed by choosing collocation point sets in the random space. The stochastic collocation method is non-intrusive in that such realizations are solved forward in time via an existing deterministic solver independently as in the Monte Carlo method. The needed entries of the state covariance matrix are approximated with the coefficients of PCE, which can be recovered from the collocation results. The system states are updated by updating the PCE coefficients. A 2D heterogeneous flow example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the SCKF with respect to different factors, such as initial guess, variance, correlation length, and the number of observations. The results are compared with those from the EnKF method. It is shown that the SCKF is computationally more efficient than the EnKF under certain conditions. Each approach has its own advantages and limitations. The performance of the SCKF decreases with larger variance, smaller correlation ratio, and fewer observations. Hence, the choice between the two methods is problem dependent. As a non-intrusive method, the SCKF can be easily extended to multiphase flow problems.},

abstract = {It is of great interest to numerous geophysical studies that the time series of global gravity field models derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data remains uninterrupted after the end of this mission. With this in mind, some institutes have been spending efforts to estimate gravity field models from alternative sources of gravimetric data. This study focuses on the gravity field solutions estimated from Swarm global positioning system (GPS) data, produced by the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern, the Astronomical Institute (ASU, Czech Academy of Sciences) and Institute of Geodesy (IfG, Graz University of Technology). The three sets of solutions are based on different approaches, namely the celestial mechanics approach, the acceleration approach and the short-arc approach, respectively. We derive the maximum spatial resolution of the time-varying gravity signal in the Swarm gravity field models to be degree 12, in comparison with the more accurate models obtained from K-band ranging data of GRACE. We demonstrate that the combination of the GPS-driven models produced with the three different approaches improves the accuracy in all analysed monthly solutions, with respect to any of them. In other words, the combined gravity field model consistently benefits from the individual strengths of each separate solution. The improved accuracy of the combined model is expected to bring benefits to the geophysical studies during the period when no dedicated gravimetric mission is operational.},

abstract = {The land-terminating margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet has slowed down in recent decades, although the causes and implications for future ice flow are unclear. Explained originally by a self-regulating mechanism where basal slip reduces as drainage evolves from low to high efficiency, recent numerical modeling invokes a sedimentary control of ice sheet flow as an alternative hypothesis. Although both hypotheses can explain the recent slowdown, their respective forecasts of a long-term deceleration versus an acceleration of ice flow are contradictory. We present amplitude-versus-angle seismic data as the first observational test of the alternative hypothesis. We document transient modifications of basal sediment strengths by rapid subglacial drainages of supraglacial lakes, the primary current control on summer ice sheet flow according to our numerical model. Our observations agree with simulations of initial postdrainage sediment weakening and ice flow accelerations, and subsequent sediment restrengthening and ice flow decelerations, and thus confirm the alternative hypothesis. Although simulated melt season acceleration of ice flow due to weakening of subglacial sediments does not currently outweigh winter slowdown forced by self-regulation, they could dominate over the longer term. Subglacial sediments beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet must therefore be mapped and characterized, and a sedimentary control of ice flow must be evaluated against competing self-regulation mechanisms.},

abstract = {The present study focuses on the Amundsen Sea sector which is the most dynamical region of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). Based on basin estimates of mass changes observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and volume changes observed by the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), the mean mass change induced by Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) is derived. This mean GIA-induced mass change is found to be 34.1. ±. 11.9. Gt/yr, which is significantly larger than the predictions of current GIA models. We show that the corresponding mean elevation change of 23.3. ±. 7.7. mm/yr in the Amundsen Sea sector is in good agreement with the uplift rates obtained from observations at three GPS sites. Utilising ICESat observations, the observed uplift rates were corrected for elastic deformations due to present-day ice-mass changes. Based on the GRACE-derived mass change estimate and the inferred GIA correction, we inferred a present-day ice-mass loss of -. 98.9. ±. 13.7. Gt/yr for the Amundsen Sea sector. This is equivalent to a global eustatic sea-level rise of 0.27. ±. 0.04. mm/yr. Compared to the results relying on GIA model predictions, this corresponds to an increase of the ice-mass loss or sea-level rise, respectively, of about 40%. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Kaban2004a,
abstract = {Based on the analysis of various factors controlling isostatic gravity anomalies and geoid undulations, it is concluded that it is essential to model the lithospheric density structure as accurately as possible. Otherwise, if computed in the 'classical' way (i.e. based on the surface topography and the simple Airy compensation scheme), isostatic anomalies mostly reflect differences of the real lithosphere structure from the simplified compensation model, and not necessarily the deviations from isostatic equilibrium. Starting with global gravity, topography and crustal density model, isostatic gravity anomalies and geoid undulations have been determined. The initial crust and upper-mantle density structure has been corrected in a least squares adjustment using gravity. To model the long-wavelength ( > 2000 km) features in the gravity field, the isostatic condition (i.e. equal mass for all columns above the compensation level) is applied in the adjustment to uncover the signals from the deep-Earth interior, including dynamic deformations of the Earth's surface. The isostatic gravity anomalies and geoid undulations, rather than the observed fields, then represent the signals from mantle convection and deep density inhomogeneities including remnants of subducted slabs. The long-wavelength non-isostatic (i.e. the dynamic) topography was estimated to range from -0.4 to 0.5 krn. For shorter wavelengths ( < 2000 km), the isostatic condition is not applied in the adjustment in order to obtain the non-isostatic topography due to regional deviations from classical Airy isostasy. The maximum deviations from Airy isostasy (-1.5 to 1 km) occur at currently active plate boundaries. As another result, a new global model of the lithosphere density distribution is generated. The most pronounced negative density anomalies in the upper mantle are found near large plume provinces, such as Iceland and East Africa, and in the vicinity of the mid-ocean ridge axes. Positive density anomalies in the upper mantle under the continents are not correlated with the cold and thick lithosphere of cratons, indicating a compensation mechanism due to thermal and compositional density.},

abstract = {The United States and Taiwan, through an Agreement signed in May 2010, have begun to jointly develop a satellite program to deliver next-generation global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) data to users around the world. This Program, known as FORMOSAT- 7/COSMIC-2, is the follow-on to the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC mission, which was a joint US-Taiwan 6-satellite constellation demonstration mission launched in April 2006. The COSMIC mission was the world's first operational GPS radio occultation (GPS-RO) mission for global weather forecast; climate monitoring; atmospheric, ionospheric, and geodetic research. The GPS-RO data from COSMIC has been extremely valuable to the climate, meteorology, and space weather communities, including real-time forecasting users as well as U.S. and international research communities. FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC reached the end of its design life in 2011. The constellation satellites have exhibited some un- recoverable anomalies and consequently the critical real-time satellite observing capability is degrading and may go offline with uncertainty in the coming few years. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) have recognized the potential GPS-RO data gap due to the degrading COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 constellation and agreed to implement the follow-on COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 mission in 2010. Both experienced programmatic difficulties in the past two years in the course of implementing the COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 Program; however, significant progress over the past six months has occurred. This paper will provide an overview of the COSMIC- 2/FORMOSAT-7 Program including the Program goals and objectives. It will also discuss the status of the Program including current satellite and constellation configuration, activities to determine the optimal and minimal ground system architecture to meet data latency requirements, and other discussions on the mission and scientific payload technology that will be used to meet the Program objectives.},

abstract = {This paper aims to simulate part of the orbital trajectory of Lunar Prospector mission to analyze the relevance of using a Kalman filter to estimate the trajectory. For this study it is considered the disturbance due to the lunar gravitational potential using one of the most recent models, the LP100K model, which is based on spherical harmonics, and considers the maximum degree and order up to the value 100. In order to simplify the expression of the gravitational potential and, consequently, to reduce the computational effort required in the simulation, in some cases, lower values for degree and order are used. Following this aim, it is made an analysis of the inserted error in the simulations when using such values of degree and order to propagate the spacecraft trajectory and control. This analysis was done using the standard deviation that characterizes the uncertainty for each one of the values of the degree and order used in LP100K model for the satellite orbit. With knowledge of the uncertainty of the gravity model adopted, lunar orbital trajectory simulations may be accomplished considering these values of uncertainty. Furthermore, it was also used a Kalman filter, where is considered the sensor's uncertainty that defines the satellite position at each step of the simulation and the uncertainty of the model, by means of the characteristic variance of the truncated gravity model. Thus, this procedure represents an effort to approximate the results obtained using lower values for the degree and order of the spherical harmonics, to the results that would be attained if the maximum accuracy of the model LP100K were adopted. Also a comparison is made between the error in the satellite position in the situation in which the Kalman filter is used and the situation in which the filter is not used. The data for the comparison were obtained from the standard deviation in the velocity increment of the space vehicle.},

abstract = {Spherical harmonics are the natural parameters for the Earth's gravity field as sensed by orbiting satellites, but problems of resolution arise because the spectrum of effects is narrow and unique to each orbit. Comprehensive gravity models now contain many hundreds of thousands of observations from more than thirty different near-Earth artificial satellites. With refinements in tracking systems, newer data is capable of sensing the spherical harmonics of the field experienced by these satellites to very high degree and order. For example, altimeter, laser and satellite-tracking-satellite systems contain gravitational information well above present levels of satellite gravity field recovery (l = 20), but significant aliasing results because the orbital parameters are too restricted compared to the large number of spherical harmonics. It is shown however that the unique spectrum of information for each satellite contained within a comprehensive spherical harmonic model can be represented by simple gravitational constraint equations (lumped harmonics). All such constraints are harmonic in the argument of perigee (??) with constants determinable directly from tracking data or reconstituted from the comprehensive solution: (C*, S*) = (Co, So) + ??i = 1 (CCi, SCi) cos i ?? + (CSi, SSi) sin i ??. The constants are simple linear combinations of the geopotential harmonics. Through these lumped harmonics any satellite gravity field can be decomposed and then uniformly extended to any degree or tailored to a given orbit without reintegration of the trajectory and variational equations. They also make possible the inclusion of information into the field from special deep resonance passages, long arc zonal analyses, and satellites unique to other models. Numerous examples of the derivation, combination, extension and tailoring of the harmonics are presented. The importance of using data spanning an apsidal period is emphasized. ?? 1982.},

abstract = {The Time Transfer by Laser Link (T2L2) experiment on-board the Jason-2 satellite was launched in June 2008 at 1335km altitude. It has been designed to use the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) space technique as an optical link between ground and space clocks. T2L2, as all the instruments aboard Jason-2, is referenced to the Ultra Stable Oscillator (USO) provided by the Doppler Orbitography and Radio-positioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system. A complex data processing has been developed in order to extract time & frequency products as the relative frequency bias of the USO from ground-to-space time transfer passages. The precision of these products was estimated of a few parts in 10-13 given the very good in-flight performance of T2L2 with a ground-to-space time stability of a few picoseconds (ps) over 100s. Frequency bias from T2L2 were compared with results from operational orbit computation, notably with the DIODE (D{\'{e}}termination Imm{\'{e}}diate d'Orbite par Doris Embarqu{\'{e}}) outputs (see Jayles et al. (2016) same issue) at the level of 1{\textperiodcentered}10-12.The present paper is focusing on the main physical effects which drive the frequency variations of the Jason-2 USO during its flight, notably over the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) area. In addition to the effects of radiation we studied the effect of the residual temperature variations, in the range 8-11°C (measured on-board). A model was established to represent these effects on the short term with empirical coefficients (sensitivities of the USO) to be adjusted. The results of fitting the model over ∼200 10-day periods, from 2008 to 2014, show the sensitivities of the Jason-2 USO to temperature and radiation. The analysis of the 6-year output series of empirical coefficients allows us to conclude that: (i) the temperature to frequency dependence is very stable along time at the level of around -1.2{\textperiodcentered}10-12 per°C, (ii) the radiation effects are much lower than those previously detected on the Jason-1 USO with a factor>10. The swept material used by manufacturers for the Jason-2 quartz oscillator has such properties to avoid non-linear effects >1-2{\textperiodcentered}10-12, (iii) the model is available at 1min or less over the Jason-2 mission, with a level of consistency of 5{\textperiodcentered}10-13, which is the average RMS of the post-fit residuals.},

abstract = {When a debris cloud is formed in the neighborhood of a constellation, the constellation satellites will face a serious threat of collision. In order to evaluate the collision probability in a long time scale, we firstly build an analytic model to describe the evolution process of the debris cloud. Under the perturbations of atmospheric drag, nonspherical gravity field, etc., results of numerical simulation indicate that after the breakup of an object, the distribution of debris cloud will evolve into a relatively stable band. Based on the stable distribution characteristic of the debris cloud, fragments are divided into several groups according their orbital heights and area-mass ratios. For each debris group, the dynamics of the distribution process under the perturbation of atmosphere drag is described by a partial differential equation (PDE). Solutions of those PDEs are obtained. And the distribution of the debris cloud can be easily propagated over long time scales. Applying this analytic model, the collision probability between a debris cloud and the Globalstar satellites is analyzed and computed. Results show that the collision probability is nearly 10,000 times of the average collision probability in the near Earth environment. Moreover, as the band distribution of the space debris cloud is stable, the collisional risk on constellation satellites will last for quite a long time.},

abstract = {A model of impact disruption of the bodies with sizes from the laboratory scale to that of an order of 100km is developed. On the lowermost end of the target size the model is based on the numerous laboratory data related to the mass-velocity distribution of the impact produced fragments. On the minor-planets scale the model is supported by the data related to the largest observed craters on small icy satellites and on some asteroids (Leliwa-Kopystynski, J., Burchell, M.J., Lowen, D. [2008]. Icarus 195, 817-826). The model takes into account the target disruption and the dispersion of the impact produced fragments against the intermolecular forces acting on the surfaces of the contacts of the fragments and against self-gravitation of the target. The head-on collisions of non-rotating and non-porous targets and impactors are considered. The impactor delivers kinetic energy but its mass is neglected in comparison to mass of the target. For this simple case the analytical formulae for specific disruption energy as well as for specific energy of formation of the largest craters are found. They depend on a set of parameters. Of these the most important (i.e. with the greatest influence on the final result) are three rather weakly known parameters. They are: (i) The exponent $\gamma$ in the distribution function of the fragments. (ii) The characteristic velocity v0 that appears in the velocity distribution of the ejected fragments. (iii) The exponent $\beta$ in the mass-velocity distribution. The influence of the choice of the numerical values of these parameters on the final results has been studied. Another group of parameters contains the relevant material data. They are: (a) The energy $\sigma$ of breaking of the intermolecular bonds of the target material per unit of the fragment surface and (b) the density $\rho$ of the target. According to our calculations the transition between the strength regime and the gravitational regime is in the range of the target radius from $\sim$0.4km to $\sim$4km. This estimate holds within a large range of parameters.An application of the results for impact cratering and/or for disruption of satellites and asteroids requires data concerning the impactor energy. We have considered rocky-rocky impacts (an asteroid on an asteroid) and icy-icy impacts (a satellite impacted by a comet). Hypothetical impacts onto some particular asteroids and satellites are discussed as examples.},

abstract = {A new concept of a global positioning support system, based on only one satellite, was offered. Unlike all other GPS and GLONASS satellite systems that are in use, within the offered modification, all metrological support is provided by on-board measurements, which means, that it does not need any ground support of coordinate measurements or orbital characteristics of the satellite system. The cosmic-based angle-measuring instrument measures the arcs lengths between the measured ground-points, that are marked with light beacons, and navigation stars. Each measurement takes approximately 0.04 s, with the precision of 1 mm in recalculation to ground-relations. Long series of arc measurements between different objects on the ground and in the sky enable the solution of both determination of geodesic coordinates of the measured points and position of the spacecraft during the measuring process by using geodesic equation methods. In addition, it enables the qualification of the geopotential guaranties. The offered scheme will be used for the determination of the frame of selenocentric coordinates during the "Luna-Globe" and "Luna-Resource" missions for precise navigation of landing modules and maybe will be used for precise gridding of the Martian surface.},

abstract = {Since its launch in 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has been providing measurements of the time-varying Earth gravity field. The GRACE mission architecture includes two satellites in near-circular, near-polar orbits separated in the along-track direction by approximately 220 km (e.g. collinear). A microwave ranging instrument measures changes in the distance between the spacecraft, while accelerometers on each spacecraft are used to measure changes in distance due to non-gravitational forces. The fact that the satellites are in near-polar orbits coupled with the fact that the inter-satellite range measurements are directed in the along-track direction, contributes to longitudinal striping in the estimated gravity fields. This paper examines four candidate mission architectures for a future gravity recovery satellite mission to assess their potential in measuring the gravity field more accurately than GRACE. All satellites were assumed to have an improved measurement system, with an inter-satellite laser ranging instrument and a drag-free system for removal of non-gravitational accelerations. Four formations were studied: a two-satellite collinear pair similar to GRACE; a four-satellite architecture with two collinear pairs; a two-satellite cartwheel formation; and a four-satellite cartwheel formation. A cartwheel formation consists of satellites performing in-plane, relative elliptical motion about their geometric center, so that inter-satellite measurements are, at times, directed radially (e.g. parallel to the direction towards the center of the Earth) rather than along-track. Radial measurements, unlike along-track measurements, have equal sensitivity to mass distribution in all directions along the Earths surface and can lead to higher spatial resolution in the derived gravity field. The ability of each architecture to recover the gravity field was evaluated using numerical simulations performed with JPLs GIPSY-OASIS software package. Thirty days of data were used to estimate gravity fields complete to degree and order 60. Evaluations were done for 250 and 400 km nominal orbit altitudes. The sensitivity of the recovered gravity field to under-sampled effects was assessed using simulated errors in atmospheric/ocean dealiasing (AOD) models. Results showed the gravity field errors associated with the four-satellite cartwheel formation were approximately one order of magnitude lower than the collinear satellite pair when only measurement system errors were included. When short-period AOD model errors were introduced, the gravity field errors for each formation were approximately the same. The cartwheel formations eliminated most of the longitudinal striping seen in the gravity field errors. A covariance analysis showed the error spectrum of the cartwheel formations to be lower and more isotropic than that of the collinear formations.},

abstract = {The International GNSS Service (IGS) provides Ultra-rapid GPS & GLONASS orbits every 6 h. Each product is composed of 24 h of observed orbits with predicted orbits for the next 24 h. We have studied how the orbit prediction performance varies as a function of the arc length of the fitted observed orbits and the parameterization strategy used to estimate the empirical solar radiation pressure (SRP) effects. To focus on the dynamical aspects of the problem, nearly ideal conditions have been adopted by using IGS Rapid orbits and known earth rotation parameters (ERPs) as observations. Performance was gauged by comparison with Rapid orbits as truth by examining WRMS and median orbit differences over the first 6-h and the full 24-h prediction intervals, as well as the stability of the Helmert frame alignment parameters. Two versions of the extended SRP orbit model developed by the Centre for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) were tested. Adjusting all nine SRPs (offsets plus once-per-revolution sines and cosines in each satellite-centered frame direction) for each satellite shows smaller mean sub-daily, scale, and origin translation differences. On the other hand, eliminating the four once-per-revolution SRP parameters in the sun-ward and the solar panel axis directions yields orbit predictions that are much more rotationally stable. We found that observed arc lengths of 40–45 h produce the most stable and accurate predictions during 2010. A combined strategy of rotationally aligning the 9 SRP results to the 5 SRP frame should give optimal predictions with about 13 mm mean WRMS residuals over the first 6 h and 50 mm over 24 h. Actual Ultra-rapid performance will be degraded due to the unavoidable rotational errors from ERP predictions.},

@article{Ray2008a,
abstract = {Prior studies of the power spectra of GPS position time series have found pervasive seasonal signals against a power-law background of flicker noise plus white noise. Dong et al. (2002) estimated that less than half the observed GPS seasonal power can be explained by redistributions of geophysical fluid mass loads. Much of the residual variation is probably caused by unidentified GPS technique errors and analysis artifacts. Among possible mechanisms, Penna and Stewart (2003) have shown how unmodeled analysis errors at tidal frequencies (near 12- and 24-hour periods) can be aliased to longer periods very efficiently. Signals near fortnightly, semiannual, and annual periods are expected to be most seriously affected. We have examined spectra for the 167 sites of the International GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) Service (IGS) network having more than 200 weekly measurements during 1996.0–2006.0. The non-linear residuals of the weekly IGS solutions that were included in ITRF2005, the latest version of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), have been used. To improve the detection of common-mode signals, the normalized spectra of all sites have been stacked, then boxcar smoothed for each local north (N), east (E), and height (H) component. The stacked, smoothed spectra are very similar for all three components. Peaks are evident at harmonics of about 1 cycle per year (cpy) up to at least 6 cpy, but the peaks are not all at strictly 1.0 cpy intervals. Based on the 6th harmonic of the N spectrum, which is among the sharpest and largest, and assuming a linear overtone model, then a common fundamental of 1.040 ± 0.008 cpy can explain all peaks well, together with the expected annual and semiannual signals. A flicker noise power-law continuum describes the background spectrum down to periods of a few months, after which the residuals become whiter. Similar sub-seasonal tones are not apparent in the residuals of available satellite laser ranging (SLR) and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) sites, which are both an order of magnitude less numerous and dominated by white noise. There is weak evidence for a few isolated peaks near 1 cpy harmonics in the spectra of geophysical loadings, but these are much noisier than for GPS positions. Alternative explanations related to the GPS technique are suggested by the close coincidence of the period of the 1.040 cpy frequency, about 351.2 days, to the “GPS year”; i.e., the interval required for the constellation to repeat its inertial orientation with respect to the sun. This could indicate that the harmonics are a type of systematic error related to the satellite orbits. Mechanisms could involve orbit modeling defects or aliasing of site-dependent positioning biases modulated by the varying satellite geometry.},

abstract = {This paper examines mass changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) monthly spherical harmonic gravity field solutions, focusing on the application to the Antarctic ice sheet. Regional integration approaches are investigated and compared with an alternative technique of fitting predefined mass change patterns. The main thrust of this new analysis is to better define error sources and error bounds on mass changes of the Antarctic ice sheet. Toward this purpose, we examine the release-4 GRACE products by the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam. Although errors related to the correction for glacial isostatic adjustment are significant, both leakage and GRACE error effects are also important. In particular, the details of how mass change interior to the Antarctic continent is weighted and scaled is crucially linked to the end-result mass trend solution. Accounting for error correlations in the GRACE monthly solutions, it is shown that the corresponding errors in Antarctic mass changes are about two times larger than predicted by uncorrelated error propagation. Our ice mass trend estimate for the grounded ice sheet in the period from 08/2002 to 01/2008 is (-109 48)Gtyr-1, equivalent to a mean eustatic sea level rise of (+0.30 0.13)mmyr-1. We also provide estimates for 16 individual drainage basins. Mass losses concentrate in the coastal regions of West Antarctica and on the Antarctic Peninsula with together (-105 35)Gtyr-1. The Amundsen Sea Sector alone contributes (-60 8)Gtyr-1. Although these findings agree with independent observations, GRACE trends deduced from a short time-series come with the cautioning footnote that the strength of interannual variations remains undetermined. We finally discuss directions of methodological improvements.},

abstract = {The GRACE satellite mission provides a near-continuous sequence of approximately 30-d gravity field solutions in the form of spherical harmonics (SH). Because SH functions are global while GRACE measurements are sensitive mainly to variations along the ground-track, undersampling (alias contamination) occurs. Here we investigate how geophysical signals are likely to cause alias error in GRACE gravity fields. We use actual GRACE orbits and systematically sample several types of time-varying signals that might represent either errors in geophysical models such as tide models, or unmodelled geophysical signals. We show how error in semi-diurnal tides like S2 can alias into long period variations in particular harmonics, particularly as a possible error source in the degree 2, order 0 term (C20) of GRACE fields. We also show that aliasing associated with non-tidal geophysical model errors is significant at order 15 or multiples of 15, due to the GRACE ground track spacing in longitude. This can be predicted from Kaulas resonance formula and might be reduced by suppressing amplitudes of affected harmonics.},

@article{Sun2010a,
abstract = {Here we decompose the space‐time variance of near‐ surface air temperature using monthly observations for the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) from 1901–2000. To do that, we developed a new method for partitioning the total space‐time variance, here called the grand variance, into separate spatial and temporal components. The temporal component is, in turn, further partitioned into the variance relating to different time periods and we use monthlydata todecompose intra‐ and inter‐annual components of the variance. The results show that the spatial and temporal components of the variance of near‐ surface air temperature have both, on average, decreased over time primarily because of reductions in the equator‐to‐ pole (northern) temperature gradient, and because in cold regions, winter is generally warming faster than summer. We also found that in most regions, the inter‐annual variance in near‐surface air temperature has increased.},

@article{Flury2005,
abstract = {After GRACE and GOCE there will still be need and room for improvement of the knowledge (1) of the static gravity field at spatial scales between 40 km and 100 km, and (2) of the time varying gravity field at scales smaller than 500 km. This is shown based on the analysis of spectral signal power of various gravity field components and on the comparison with current knowledge and expected performance of GRACE and GOCE. Both, accuracy and resolution can be improved by future dedicated gravity satellite missions. For applications in geodesy, the spectral omission error due to the limited spatial resolution of a gravity satellite mission is a limiting factor. The recommended strategy is to extend as far as possible the spatial resolution of future missions, and to improve at the same time the modelling of the very small scale components using terrestrial gravity information and topographic models.We discuss the geodetic needs in improved gravity models in the areas of precise height systems, GNSS levelling, inertial navigation and precise orbit determination. Today global height systems with a 1 cm accuracy are required for sea level and ocean circulation studies. This can be achieved by a future satellite mission with higher spatial resolution in combination with improved local and regional gravity field modelling. A similar strategy could improve the very economic method of determination of physical heights by GNSS levelling from the decimeter to the centimeter level. In inertial vehicle navigation, in particular in sub-marine, aircraft and missile guidance, any improvement of global gravity field models would help to improve reliability and the radius of operation.},

abstract = {We are presenting a method for removing attitude-related variations\n(ATTRVs) in dynamic 1 Hz GPS positioning. The ATTRVs are separated\ninto vertical and horizontal components. These result from the translational\nand rotational motions of the vehicle, which is a marine research\nvessel in our case. We have developed new observation equations that\nuse corrected pseudoranges and carrier phases to account for ATTRVs.\nIn the present contribution, we are only focusing on the vertical\nsignals. These modeled ATTRVs are included as corrections in the\nline-of-sight (LoS) to each GPS satellite in the RINEX data sets\nusing a new software called RNXATTCOR. Precise IGS sp3-orbits are\nused as inputs together with precise lever arm coordinates of the\nonboard GPS antennas, observations from the marine inertial navigation\nsystem and a priori 3D position of the vessel. The corrected RINEX\ndata sets are then processed using kinematic processing or sequential\nprocessing in Precise Point Positioning (PPP) mode. The reduction\nof the standard deviation from a running mean in the final processed\nGPS time series is about 95%. The current method is being proposed\nfor marine geodesy science applications such as along-track calibration/validation\nof altimetry products, and also for applications related to offshore\nkinematic high precision GPS positioning such as drilling, offshore\nplatforms stability, marine pipeline positioning, earthquake monitoring\nand tsunami detection. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites observed a +/-15-microgalileo gravity change induced by the great December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. Coseismic deformation produces sudden changes in the gravity field by vertical displacement of Earth's layered density structure and by changing the densities of the crust and mantle. GRACE's sensitivity to the long spatial wavelength of gravity changes resulted in roughly equal contributions of vertical displacement and dilatation effects in the gravity measurements. The GRACE observations provide evidence of crustal dilatation resulting from an undersea earthquake.},

abstract = {Large uncertainties remain in the current and future contribution to sea level rise from Antarctica. Climate warming may increase snowfall in the continent's interior1, 2, 3, but enhance glacier discharge at the coast where warmer air and ocean temperatures erode the buttressing ice shelves4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Here, we use satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar observations from 1992 to 2006 covering 85% of Antarctica's coastline to estimate the total mass flux into the ocean. We compare the mass fluxes from large drainage basin units with interior snow accumulation calculated from a regional atmospheric climate model for 1980 to 2004. In East Antarctica, small glacier losses in Wilkes Land and glacier gains at the mouths of the Filchner and Ross ice shelves combine to a near-zero loss of 4±61 Gt yr−1. In West Antarctica, widespread losses along the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas increased the ice sheet loss by 59% in 10 years to reach 132±60 Gt yr−1 in 2006. In the Peninsula, losses increased by 140% to reach 60±46 Gt yr−1 in 2006. Losses are concentrated along narrow channels occupied by outlet glaciers and are caused by ongoing and past glacier acceleration. Changes in glacier flow therefore have a significant, if not dominant impact on ice sheet mass balance.},

abstract = {The Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 26, 2004 devastated coastal ecosystems across South Asia. Along the coastal regions of South India, increased groundwater levels (GWL), largely caused by saltwater intrusion, infiltration from inundated land, and disturbance of freshwater lenses, were reported. Many agencies allocated funding for restoration and rehabilitation projects. However, to streamline funding allocation efforts, district-level groundwater inundation/recession data would have been a useful tool for planners. Thus, to ensure better preparedness for future disaster relief operations, it is crucial to quantify pre- and post-tsunami groundwater levels across coastal districts in India. Since regional scale GWL field observations are not often available, this study instead used space gravimetry data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), along with soil moisture data from the Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (GLDAS), to quantify GWL fluctuations caused by the tsunami. A time-series analysis of equivalent groundwater thickness was developed for February 2004–December 2005 and the results indicated a net increase of 274 % in GWLs along coastal regions in Tamil Nadu following the tsunami. The net recharge volume of groundwater due to the tsunami was 16.8 km3, just 15 % lower than the total annual groundwater recharge (19.8 km3) for the state of Tamil Nadu. Additionally, GWLs returned to average within 3 months following the tsunami. The analysis demonstrated the utility of remotely sensed data in predicting and assessing the impacts of natural disasters.},

None of these quantities are assimilated directly and thus an assessment of their variability provides an independent measure of the accuracy. The CFSR is compared with observational estimates and three previous reanalyses (the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis or R1, the NCEP/DOE reanalysis or R2, and the ERA40 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). The CFSR has improved time-mean precipitation distribution over various regions compared to the three previous reanalyses, leading to a better representation of freshwater flux (evaporation minus precipitation). For interannual variability, the CFSR shows improved precipitation correlation with observations over the Indian Ocean, Maritime Continent, and western Pacific. The T2m of the CFSR is superior to R1 and R2 with more realistic interannual variability and long-term trend. On the other hand, the CFSR overestimates downward solar radiation flux over the tropical Western Hemisphere warm pool, consistent with a negative cloudiness bias and a positive sea surface temperature bias. Meanwhile, the evaporative latent heat flux in CFSR appears to be larger than other observational estimates over most of the globe. A few deficiencies in the long-term variations are identified in the CFSR. Firstly, dramatic changes are found around 1998-2001 in the global average of a number of variables, possibly related to the changes in the assimilated satellite observations. Secondly, the use of multiple streams for the CFSR induces spurious jumps in soil moisture between adjacent streams. Thirdly, there is an inconsistency in long-term sea ice extent variations over the Arctic regions between the CFSR and other observations with the CFSR showing smaller sea ice extent before 1997 and larger extent starting in 1997. These deficiencies may have impacts on the application of the CFSR for climate diagnoses and predictions. Relationships between surface heat fluxes and SST tendency and between SST and precipitation are analyzed and compared with observational estimates and other reanalyses. Global mean fields of surface heat and water fluxes together with radiation fluxes at the top of the atmosphere are documented and presented over the entire globe, and for the ocean and land separately.},

abstract = {The first in situ sounding of a post-seismic infrasound wavefront is presented, using data from the GOCE mission. The atmospheric infrasounds following the great Tohoku earthquake (on 11 March 2011) induce variations of air density and vertical acceleration of the GOCE platform. These signals are detected at two positions along the GOCE orbit corresponding to a crossing and a doubling of the infrasonic wavefront created by seismic surface waves. Perturbations up to 11% of air density and 1.35 × 10 − 7 m/s2 of vertical acceleration are observed and modeled with two different solid-atmosphere coupling codes. These perturbations are a due to acoustic waves creating vertical velocities up to 130 m/s. Amplitudes and arrival times of these perturbations are reproduced respectively within a factor 2, and within a 60 s time window. Waveforms present a good agreement with observed data. The vertical acceleration to air density perturbation ratio is higher for these acoustic waves than for gravity waves. Combining these two pieces of information offers a new way to distinguish between these two wave types. This new type of data is a benchmark for the models of solid-atmosphere coupling. Amplitude and frequency content constrain the infrasound attenuation related to atmosphere viscosity and thermal conductivity. Observed time shifts between data and synthetics are ascribed to lateral variations of the seismic and atmospheric sound velocities and to the influence of atmospheric winds. These effects should be included in future modeling. This validation of our modeling tools allows to specify more precisely future observation projects.},

@article{Pie2013,
abstract = {The gravity missions GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) and GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) have brought great improvements in the study of Earth Dynamic processes. Though they are very different in nature, the two missions provide very complementary gravity products, expressed in the form of spherical harmonic expansions. The complementarity of the two missions comes from the fact that GRACE gravity products have superior accuracy in the estimation of the low to medium degree terms, while GOCE prevails in the higher degrees. Several combination gravity fields already make use of this complementarity. However, detailed quality analysis of this products reveals characteristic errors in gravity fields resulting in North-South striations, or even small-scale bumpy patterns over the ocean. It is believed that the striations are likely to be attributed to the GRACE data at degree superior to 100 of the spherical harmonic expansion, while the bumpy pattern could be the results of non-optimal weighting at degrees where GRACE and GOCE's accuracy are commensurate. In the context of the Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) computation, these errors can become so predominant that they prompted the community to apply heavy smoothing filters to the geodetic MDT models, therefore removing most mesoscale signals out of the resulting MDT. MDT based on satellite-only gravity models computed in such fashion are not appropriate to resolve mean spatial mesoscale ocean circulation patterns and geostrophic currents, putting in question their usefulness in the first place. The focus of this study is to characterize the geoid error in GRACE+GOCE combination gravity models in the spatial domain and in the context of the determination of the MDT. By using spatial spectrum editing instead of a regular smoothing approach, we show that we can greatly reduce the geoid errors while doing much less damage to the MDT mesoscale signals and the subsequent mean geostrophic currents.},

abstract = {Global dynamic processes cause variations in the Earth's rotation, which are monitored by various geometric observation techniques such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) with millimeter accuracy. The integral effect on Earth rotation of mass displacements and motion is therefore precisely known, but the separation of contributions from particular geodynamic processes remains a challenge. Here we show that the oceanic mass effect on Earth rotation can be derived from both time variable gravity field solutions from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and sea level anomalies (SLA) observed from satellite altimeter missions. The GRACE solutions require filtering and the application of an ocean mask, whereas the SLA need to be corrected for the steric effect as polar motion is only affected by mass redistributions. We assess the accuracy of our oceanic polar motion excitations by using GRACE and SLA solutions from different processing centers. In addition, we compare polar motion excitations from GRACE, satellite altimeter data and their combinations with excitations estimated from ocean models. We show that the combination of gravimetric and altimetric solutions reduces systematic errors of the individual solutions. The combined solutions are about 2 times more accurate than ocean model results and about 3 times more accurate than the so-called reduced geodetic excitation functions. We anticipate our analysis to be valuable input for improved modeling of oceanic mass redistributions.},

abstract = {The problem of observing geocenter motion from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) solutions through the network shift approach is addressed from the perspective of collinearity (or multicollinearity) among the parameters of a least-squares regression. A collinearity diagnosis, based on the notion of variance inflation factor, is therefore developed and allows handling several peculiarities of the GNSS geocenter determination problem. Its application reveals that the determination of all three components of geocenter motion with GNSS suffers from serious collinearity issues, with a comparable level as in the problem of determining the terrestrial scale simultaneously with the GNSS satellite phase center offsets. The inability of current GNSS, as opposed to satellite laser ranging, to properly sense geocenter motion is mostly explained by the estimation, in the GNSS case, of epoch-wise station and satellite clock offsets simultaneously with tropospheric parameters.

abstract = {GFZ Potsdam and GRGS Toulouse have a long-time close cooperation in the field of global gravity field determination at which the present focus is (1) on GOCE gravity field determination and (2) on computation of combined gravity field models. The goal of GOCE is to map the gravity field of the Earth at a spatial resolution of about 100 km (i.e. spherical harmonics to degree and order 200) with an accumulated geoid error of less than 2-3 cm at this scale. We apply the direct numerical approach to compute GOCE gravity fields. This comprises (1) the estimation of the long wavelength gravity field signal from a dynamic orbit computation using precise kinematic orbit positions as observations (pseudo-SST) and (2) the discovery of the short wavelength information by analyzing the satellite gravity gradients (SGG). The 3-axes GOCE-gradiometer provides gravity gradients which are measurable with a high precision only within the measurement bandwidth (mbw) of approximately 0.005 to 0.1 Hz. This requires appropriate filtering of the gravity gradients and the associated observation equations. For this purpose we use an order 12 10-125 mHz band-pass filter. The pseudo-SST and the SGG measurements are processed separately, producing SST and high-resolution SGG normal equations. These matrices are subsequently combined and solved using Cholesky decomposition. Due to the polar gaps in the GOCE data, we apply the spherical cap regularization. In preparation of the fourth gravity field model that will be delivered to the scientific community in February 2013, we have computed a set of new GOCE gravity field models using the reprocessed gravity gradients provided by GOCE-HPF including the test-wise application of different band-pass filters We included the GOCE data in the combination of satellite and ground-based gravity data to obtain high-resolution global gravity field models. The first combined model containing GOCE data is our initial release of EIGEN-6, the latest combined EIGEN-model (EIGEN = European Improved Gravity model of the Earth by New techniques), published in 2011. It was computed from a combination of LAGEOS, GRACE and GOCE data, augmented with the DTU10 surface gravity data and is complete to degree and order 1440 (corresponding to 14 km spatial resolution). Now we present our new release of EIGEN-6 which is complete to degree and order 1990 (corresponding to 10 km spatial resolution). Furthermore this new model comprises extended measurement time spans for the LAGEOS/GRACE data as well as for the GOCE data. The comparison of test results (orbit computation, GPS leveling) of this latest EIGEN model with GOCE-only models, EGM2008 and ITG10S demonstrates the gain in accuracy at high degrees, while its performance is identical to a GRACE-only model for the low degrees. Compared to the first release of EIGEN-6 this new release shows a general improvement. Oceanographic validation of the new EIGEN-model in comparison to other global gravity field models is performed through the analysis of differences between mean geostrophic currents derived from the tested gravity field models and inferred from drifter data as a function of resolution (down to 100 km). The GOCE processing within this work was done in the framework of the European GOCE Gravity Consortium (EGG-C) under ESA contract within the ESA GOCE High Level Processing Facility (GOCE-HPF).},

abstract = {The Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC) is a clockwise ocean flow from west to east around Antarctica, connecting the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans, and plays a key role in the heat transport and climate change. The geostrophic surface currents can be derived from the ocean dynamic height as the deviation of the actual sea level from satellite altimetry and the Earth's geoid. Although the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer (GOCE) mission provided an initial estimate of global geostrophic currents, a more detailed Antarctic circumpolar current is still not well estimated. In this paper, the detailed ACC is estimated from the newest ITG-Grace2010 gravity model based on 7-years of GRACE data, and GO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R3 gravity model (hereafter referred to GOCE-TIM3) based on 12 months of GOCE data, with the mean sea surface height model MSS_CNES_CLS_11 from satellite altimetry, respectively. The evaluation and comparisons are performed with oceanographic models, the GOCO03S gravity model as well as in situ drifter's measurements. Results show that the Antarctic circumpolar current based on GOCE gravity field model depicts more details and transport characteristics with high accuracy and spatial resolution, e.g., Agulhas currents and Brazil-Malvinas Confluence regions, which are more consistent with the in situ drifter's results. The ACC based on ITG-Grace2010 model is similar with the result of the GOCE-TIM3 model with RMS of 8.39. cm/s and 7.85. cm/s, respectively, while the accuracy of GOCE-TIM3 is still higher. The correlation coefficients of the estimated velocities, compared to drifter results, are 0.70 and 0.76 for ITG-Grace2010 and GOCE-TIM3. ITG-Grace2010 model has more noise in the higher spherical harmonic coefficients and some better performances in the geostrophic currents are able to be obtained if the degrees are truncated to 160 for ITG-Grace2010, while the GOCE-TIM3 and GOCO03S model do not have this phenomenon. The gravity model GOCO03S with combined CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE observations almost have no improvement in ACC estimate when compared with GOCE-TIM3 results, while the RMS of GOCO03S is a little larger than the GOCE-TIM3 results. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
